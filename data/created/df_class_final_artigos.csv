0,1,Radical Reorganization of Environmental Policy: Contemporaneous Evidence from Brazil,An overview of environmental policy in Brazil since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January 2019 suggests that the rise to power of a new political elite has led to a radical change in Brazil's trajectory of climate change initiatives and environmental protection. The new elite is associated with the disruption of two factors historically relevant for the design of environmental policy: the participation of civil society in the governance of public policy and multilateralism in matters of environment policy.,Climate Change
1,2,Environmental policy integration in a newly established natural resource-based sector: the role of advocacy coalitions and contrasting conceptions of sustainability,"Contributing a new South American case study, this paper seeks to advance the research agenda on processes of policy integration by developing a better understanding of how nascent subsystems become integrated into mature ones and the role that changing beliefs of advocacy coalitions play in fostering policy integration. The paper examines environmental policy integration in Uruguay's forestry sector since the 1990s and is based on an inductive qualitative analysis of policy documents, sector reports, parliament hearings and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders. This demonstrates that environmental policy integration has increased continuously since the 1990s, accelerating particularly during the 2000s. We can derive three insights that specifically address this path of integration: a change in the policy beliefs of the dominant advocacy coalition, international salience of the minority coalition`s beliefs and participatory policy processes that foster interactions between opposing coalitions. Despite this, the two advocacy coalitions have crystallized with fundamentally different deep core beliefs about what a sustainable forestry sector should be. While one coalition argues that commercial tree plantations are sufficiently regulated in environmental terms, the other coalition maintains that the way that the pulp industry has developed in Uruguay is fundamentally unsustainable and therefore seeks to change the forestry sector as a whole.",Forests and Land Use
2,3,"Participatory interventions for collective action and sustainable resource management: linking actors, situations and contexts through the IAD, NAS and SES frameworks","Overcoming complex environmental challenges demands different forms of stakeholder participation and collective action. While informative and relevant for participatory interventions, the literatures on collective action and participatory governance have largely remained disconnected. We illustrate how the institutional analysis and development (IAD), network of (adjacent) action situation (NAS) and social–ecological system (SES) frameworks can be combined to provide a coherent approach that integrates these literatures, applies their insights and bridges this disconnect. We compare two similar participatory interventions, one in Colombia and one in Peru, whose design and implementation we supported. Transdisciplinary in nature, both sought to foster collective action for watershed management. The frameworks allow us to demarcate, characterise and reflect upon the action situations (ASs) for the collective choice, coordination and knowledge generation that constituted each participatory intervention (i.e. the constituent NAS) and other relevant operational and institutional ASs that lay outside the boundaries of the participatory interventions. These other ASs may not be linked to one another or to the intervention’s constituent NAS, but they influence the outcomes of interest nevertheless, thereby shaping the potential of the participatory interventions for collective action and sustainable natural resource management. The framework then suggests, and our comparative analysis illustrates, that organisers and researchers of participatory interventions, such as multi-actor deliberative platforms and transdisciplinary research projects, should carefully consider, reflect upon and address the constellation of relevant actors, ASs and contexts co-determining the outcomes of interest. Our study demonstrates how the IAD, SES and NAS frameworks can support that endeavour.",Freshwater Governance
3,4,Presidents and intermediaries: insights from clean energy policy processes in Mexico,"We assess whether different presidents have different styles of involving intermediary organizations such as trade unions or business associations in the policy process. Given that temporal variation in the relationship between presidents and intermediaries can be observed, to what extent can the intermediaries included in the policy process be explained by the respective president's leadership style and/or political ideology? We concentrate on the process by which clean energy policies were formulated under three Mexican presidents between 2006 and 2022. We draw on original data collected through 18 semi-structured interviews carried out with intermediaries between January and July 2022. Our findings show that the different presidents had different policy styles and therefore varied in how they included climate intermediaries in the policy process. This finding has important implications for research on policy styles as well as climate intermediation. Regarding policy styles the results presented call for theorizing of the dynamics observed. As concerns climate intermediaries the corresponding literature is invited to pay more attention to the political context in which they operate.",Multi-Theme
4,5,Narratives and practices of pesticide removal in the Andean valleys of Chile and Argentina,"The hegemony of the agribusiness model in Latin America has consolidated the implementation of the Green Revolution technological package in which pesticides play a fundamental role. Yet in the face of its negative social, economic, and environmental effects, many medium-capitalized producers, petty commodity producers, and peasants have developed various food production strategies beyond extensive pesticide use. Drawing from the convergence between rural sociology and agroecology, we address the narratives and practices of farming families that are constructing alternatives to pesticides. Our analysis focuses not only on the productive dimension but also on the political and cultural aspects of the strategies that the subjects deploy when distancing themselves from the hegemonic practices of agribusiness. To approach this objective, we combine an analysis of in-depth interviews and ethnographic notes carried out in the municipality of Putaendo (Valparaiso, Chile) and the Antinaco-Los Colorados valley (La Rioja, Argentina). The article contributes to previous theoretical work on alternative agriculture by analyzing practices and narratives as seen from four different levels: microeconomics, macroeconomics, politics, and family labor. Drawing from a combination of these perspectives, the agrarian producers in our study explain and exemplify the growth, deployment, threats and staying power of practices distinct to or in opposition to agribusiness. Additionally, the research confirms that the analysis of alternatives for changing agriculture should consider the interaction between technical components, such as the reduction or elimination of chemical pesticides, economic balance, such as providing an “adequate” level of income, and cultural elements, such as the co-existence of economic systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Energy Transition
5,6,"Ambiente, sustentabilidad y desigualdad: el caso del vertedero en San Carlos de Bariloche (2001-2019)","This article analyzes the link between three concepts: environment, sustainability and inequality. From the case of the Landfill of the city of San Carlos de Bariloche (Río Negro), the distributive effects of environmental policies (or the lack of them) are analyzed in three interdependent actors: social, private and state (including scientific-technological). Reconstructing the information from semi-structured interviews with key actors and bibliographic works that address this case, this article seeks to answer the question, what reasons explain why the main environmental problem in the city of Bariloche cannot be solved? It is concluded that the lack of a minimum vision among the group of actors over time is sufficient reason for the impossibility of solving the main environmental problem of the city.",Multi-Theme
6,7,"Conflicting Sovereignties: Global Conservation, Protected Areas, and Indigenous Nations in the Peruvian Amazon","Indigenous organizations, international actors, and national authorities portray different images of Indigenous Peoples' relationship with the natural environment. Based on these images, these actors deploy ecological, economic, and security arguments to create or transform protected areas. By exploring three cases of conflicts over creation and management of protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon, this article maps the tensions around the different images and explores how Indigenous organizations and state authorities-backed by international actors-engage with security, economic, and ecological rationales from their own sovereignty standpoint. I argue that the state weakens Indigenous political aspiration of sovereign territorial control by translating this agenda into depoliticized mechanisms and assumptions of modern international environmentalism, which ultimately limits their capacity to truly contribute to conservation goals. A nation-building approach to conservation, by conceiving Indigenous Nations as sovereign partners in environmental management, might give legitimacy to environmental initiatives.",Energy Transition
7,8,Cooperação intermunicipal na Política Nacional de Meio Ambiente: as capacidades estatais importam?,"The institutional framework of the National Environmental System assigns complex responsibilities to municipalities, which are often unviable in financial, technical, and operational terms. Cooperation emerges as an alternative to face the lack of resources and the inability of some municipalities to execute the guidelines provided for by the National Environmental Policy in an isolated way. This research examines the relationship between intermunicipal cooperation and municipal state capacities in the implementation of the environmental policy in Brazil, aiming to identify if state capacity, in different dimensions, is a relevant characteristic for municipalities participating in environmental public consortiums. This research used secondary data to employ a quantitative approach through logistic regression analysis, investigating the occurrence of intermunicipal cooperative arrangements in 4.479 Brazilian municipalities. In general terms, the results demonstrate that high administrative capacity and greater fiscal performance tend to reduce the incentives for the municipality to cooperate with others while implementing the PNMA at the local level. Also, the findings indicate that the availability of technical, political-relational, and institutional capacity increases the probability of cooperation.",Forests and Land Use
8,9,Implementing community-based forest management in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest: a strategic action fields perspective,"We assess the conditions under which forest-dependent groups in the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest may overcome inequalities in the legal access to forest resources. Through the development of contrasting case studies, we address attempts made by two community-based associations that represent those groups to legalize their timber production. We explore the dominance and mobilization of resources and draw on the Strategic Action Fields perspective to organize and systematically compare the case studies. Results reveal that to overcome existing barriers to legalization, communities need to create a social movement dynamic to seize opportunities caused by the exogenous interferences in local social orders. Skilled social actors need to mobilize powerful supporters to accumulate resource endowments necessary to put forward the legalization process. These results are particularly important considering the enormous environmental importance of the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest, the increase in deforestation rates, and the precarious socio-economic situation of forest-dependent peoples.",Forests and Land Use
9,10,The politics of climate change adaptation in Brazil: framings and policy outcomes for the rural sector,"This study addresses the problem of defining the scope and substance of the climate adaptation policy, which operates with comprehensive objectives and engages with multiple meanings, policy tools, and sectors to allow societies to cope with the effects of climate change. Analyzing the design of Brazil's National Adaptation Plan sheds light on the main goals and tools of the country's adaptation strategy for the rural sector and its divergent policy approaches at distinct subnational levels. This study shows that the government's ambition for promoting change drove the design process by mainstreaming climate adaptation goals into well-established development agendas, but it resulted in the layering of existing sector-based instruments. The Plan became a mix of loosely coordinated and inconsistent strategies, lacking a common implementation approach. Thereby, this analysis provides insight into the politics of adaptation policies and the challenges of promoting policy integration in this field.",Climate Change

11,12,Unpacking the process: how agenda-setting theory explains the case of creating large scale marine protected areas in Brazil,"In 2018, Brazil announced the designation of two new Large Scale Marine Protected Areas (LSMPAs), resulting in an increase in protection from 1.5% to 26.36% of the country's maritime territory. We employ an agenda-setting theory to analyze the Brazilian LSMPAs as a causal case study, unpacking the factors that led to their creation, and providing insights about the process of reaching global targets. Drawing on a detailed literature analysis and interviews with key stakeholders, we argue that reaching an international goal is a political commitment which emerges within a 'policy window.' Additionally, we offer seven lessons that can improve the chances of reaching an international goal and shifting the agenda: (1) attract media attention; (2) make a formal commitment; (3) launch a movement or a campaign to attain the goal; (4) make the goals legally binding; (5) propose general international goals; (6) diffuse ideas and (7) form support groups.",Marine/Ocean Governance
12,13,Is there room for a circular economy “from below”? Reflections on privatisation and commoning of circular waste loops in Argentina,"The Circular Economy (CE) narrative is spreading at a global scale, addressing different actors and settings, and thus facing new theoretical and empirical challenges. However, CE initiatives in the Global South have tended to extrapolate developed countries’ perspectives, as if the CE provides a global and universal benchmark to converge to. Drawing from a political ecology of waste in Latin America and building on empirical data derived from two case studies of recycling initiatives in Argentina, we focus on how the issue of formalisation of previously informal recyclers could be framed within the CE. Then, we outline two contrasting models, the privatisation of informality on the one hand and the formalisation of commoning on the other. Thus we highlight the extent to which the CE narrative could be used to overlook power relations dynamics, or, to what extent it could be reframed to foster a CE “from below” that could provide a clear path to achieve greater levels of equity and social justice. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Energy Transition
13,14,Green Fences for Buenos Aires: Implementing Green Infrastructure for (More than) Air Quality,"Schoolyards in North America and Europe are increasingly using green fences as one measure to protect vulnerable populations from localised air pollution. This paper assesses the possibilities and limits for mobilising this format of site-specific green infrastructure in cities in low-and middle-income countries beset by air pollution and multiple other socio-environmental challenges, and particularly questions the definition of green fences as a green infrastructure for air quality (GI4AQ). We applied several qualitative and action research methods to the question of green fence implementation in Buenos Aires, Argentina—a Latin American city with weak air-quality policies, limited green infrastructure, and little experience with nature-based solutions. Firstly, we conducted a literature review of the role that urban vegetation and ecosystem services may play in AQ policy and the implementation barriers to such approaches globally and in the city. Secondly, we planned, designed, constructed, maintained, and evaluated a pilot green fence in a school playground. Thirdly, we carried out supplementary interviews with stakeholders and expert informants and compiled project members’ narratives to respectively characterise the barriers that the project encountered and delineate its attributes based on the associated actions that we took to overcome such barriers to implementation and complete the pilot. Our findings identify multiple barriers across seven known categories (institutional, engagement, political, socio-cultural, built environment and natural landscape, knowledge base and financial) and highlight examples not previously considered in the extant international literature. Furthermore, learning from this experience, the paper proposes an expanded model of green infrastructure for air quality plus multi-dimensional co-benefits (GI4AQ+) to increase implementation chances by attending to local needs and priorities. © 2022 by the authors.

14,15,Bolsonaro's far-right populist environmental and climate diplomacy,"Brazilian diplomacy has historically used the environmental agenda as a soft-power tool, particularly regarding climate change, but this situation has drastically changed under Jair Bolsonaro's administration. Imitating other far-right populists and their antienvironmental rhetoric, especially Donald Trump's, Bolsonaro attempted to use the topic to inflame his domestic supporters against international players. On the one hand, this strategy weakened Brazilian influence in bilateral and multilateral forums; on the other, dismantling environmental policies and governance structures had substantial consequences, especially in deforestation rates and attacks on traditional communities. This article analyzes the Bolsonaro administration's stand on the environment and climate issues and the repercussions of its policies and rhetoric in Brazil's domestic and foreign scenarios. We conclude that changes in the international context, especially after Trump's electoral defeat in the United States, led to a softening of Bolsonaro's international environmental and climate discourse, with no substantial policy changes internally. Although climate denialism is a centerpiece of the discourse of far-right populists, this empirical analysis indicates that, in the case of Brazil, this narrative did not bring significant results to Bolsonaro in terms of support or international relevance.",Climate Change
15,16,"Entre la economía y la política, factores que activan coaliciones. Aportes teóricos a la luz de la adecuación e implementación de una política ambiental nacional en tres provincias argentinas (2008-2019)","This article argues that the activation and action of coalitions are relevant to understand the processes of design and enforcement of public policies. However, coalitions do not always activate or take the same form. According to this analytical dilemma, the question that guides this article is: What are the factors that activate coalitions and affect the type of coalition built? This study is the product of twenty interviews with key actors and the analysis of public documents prepared by environmental organizations, subnational state organizations, and media. Morover, it compares the design and enforcement of an environmental policy in three Argentine provinces. As a result, it was found that the activation of the coalitions depends on a structural-economic factor called the dispute over natural resources, while the type of coalition depends on the degree of opening of the political system.",Energy Transition
16,17,Gradual and Transformative Institutional Change: the influence of stakeholders and advocacy coalitions at the Belo Monte Hydroelectric power plant,"This work analyzes the performance of stakeholders and advocacy coalitions in processes of gradual institutional change based on the case study of the Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant. The methodology adopts content analysis, using shorthand notes of hearings held in the National Congress, and other publicly available documents. In-depth semi-structured interviews were also conducted, collecting data from individuals involved in the history of the power plant. The study allowed to characterize stakeholders pro or against the enterprise, observing their degree of influence and the role played. In addition, the work used the Advocacy Coalition Framework to verify how stakeholders formed three advocacy coalitions and exerted the strategies of institutional change ‘displacement,’ ‘conversion,’ and ‘layering’ following the gradual and transformative institutional change model. Empirical evidence indicates that the composition of coalition members may determine the type of institutional change and that institutional changes can also result from learning among coalitions, as the incorporation of socio-environmental considerations that have altered the original design of the hydroelectric power plant.",Energy Transition
17,18,The political impact of environmental mobilization: a theoretical discussion in the light of the Argentine case [Impacto político de la movilización ambiental: Una discusión conceptual a la luz del caso argentino],"Upon the third wave of democratization, environmental mobilization has increased throughout Latin America. In line with this process, the literature has analyzed different aspects of environmental mobilization, such as the types of groups involved and the resources mobilized. Yet, less attention has been paid to the impacts of those mobilizations. So, we ask: what are the impacts of environmental mobilization and how can they be best understood? Based on a review of the literature and on our own studies on Argentina, we build a novel typology to explain the connection between the political impacts of environmental mobilization and their concrete effects on the environment. We argue that the best way to understand those impacts is to analyze the state decisions that respond to such a mobilization, focusing on two key dimensions: the spatial and the temporal scope. We illustrate our typology with the analysis of four different environmental areas in Argentina. © 2021 CALACS.",Energy Transition
18,19,Dealing with cross-sectoral policy problems: An advocacy coalition approach to climate and water policy integration in Northeast Brazil,"The governance of several cross-cutting challenges, such as food security, climate change, and sustainable development, calls for integrative policy approaches. However, eforts to better theorize the drivers of integration beyond listing explanatory factors remain weak. Viewing integration as a process of policy change for dealing with complex problems, this study argues that policy integration analysis can beneft from an advocacy coalition approach (ACF) to address this theoretical gap. It illustrates the analytical framework by empirically investigating the drivers of policy (dis)integration in Brazil’s subnational water policy introduced in the 2010s. The level of confict between coalitions, adjustment of policy beliefs, coordination within and across coalitions, and existence of venues for interaction and policy-oriented learning were presented as factors that can foster or hinder the integration of public policies. Moreover, the study discusses the potential to acknowledge in ACF the mechanisms for coordinating policy actors and instruments, which would facilitate the analysis of the policy processes of cooperation. It also demonstrates that recent droughts in Northeast Brazil have been increasingly related to the local impacts of climate change, contributing to reframing water management as a cross-sectoral climate and water governance issue. The analysis was based on a literature review, semi-structured interviews, and social network analysis.",Climate Change
19,20,Multilevel business power in environmental politics: the avocado boom and water scarcity in Chile,"The production and export of avocados in Chile have experienced explosive growth since the 1990s, severely threatening local communities' human right to water. Despite contentious activities and protest, there has been scant reaction from public authorities and policy continues to strongly support avocado exports. We explain this by analyzing the role that business plays in water politics and the different means it has to counter the search for political influence by aggrieved communities. We argue that the outcome is a product of the multilevel deployment of business power. Based on quantitative and qualitative data, we use process tracing methods to unveil business power mechanisms at the local, national and international levels and their connections. We contribute to the cross-fertilization of business power analyses in comparative political economy and environmental politics, and to the understanding of the under-researched multilevel dynamics of business power and the related politics of scale shift.",Freshwater Governance
20,21,Indigenous territories and governance of forest restoration in the Xingu River (Brazil),"During the early 2000s, indigenous and non-indigenous peoples inhabiting the headwaters of the Xingu River (Mato Grosso state, Brazil) engaged in a collective decision to undertake the Y Ikatu Xingu Campaign, a social phenomenon and forum for the restoration and protection of Xingu’s headwaters and riparian forests—a common-pool resource shared by indigenous, farmers, and urban populations in the region. These areas have been significantly deforested over the last 50 years due to public policies and land privatization aiming at economic development, agricultural, and agribusiness expansion in Central and Amazonian Brazil. These political and economic drivers contributed to the conversion of five million hectares of Seasonal Evergreen Forests and Cerrados (Brazilian savanna) into agricultural land. To reverse the damaging trends threatening the future of the Xingu River and to promote common benefits to indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, the Campaign fostered the creation of the Xingu Seed Network to promote the exchange and commercialization of native seeds demanded by farmers and landholders for planting and restoring permanent preservation areas, such as riparian forests and vegetation associated with lakes and springs of the Suiá-Miçu River Basin. The aim of this study is to examine the role played by the Y Ikatu Campaign in the conservation of these common-pool resources—Xingu’s headwaters, riparian forests, and rivers—and in mobilizing heterogeneous social groups living in this region to engage in the protection of the watershed. Our analysis focuses on socially and culturally diverse inhabitants (indigenous and farmers) of the Suiá-Miçu River Basin, who are searching for innovative technologies for the recovery of riparian areas and for income generation for local communities. The Institutional Analysis and Development framework was adopted as an approach for understanding interactions of multiple social agents, governmental and non-governmental organizations, engaged in the process of restoration and protection of common resources. Spatial and temporal land-cover changes analysis of the Suiá-Miçu River Basin show an increase in deforestation during the past 40 years, primarily for soybean farming and pastures. We showed that indigenous people have a fundamental role in questioning and advancing the outcomes of restoration efforts, and monitoring environmental impact on water quality of rivers, as well as on conditions of forests and other ecosystems surrounding indigenous lands. We discuss the perspectives of Kĩsêdjê indigenous inhabitants on the environmental governance related to restoration efforts and monitoring, and their concerns with a dynamic scenario of agribusiness expansion in the Xingu River Headwaters region.",Forests and Land Use
21,22,"Environmental governance under Bolsonaro: dismantling institutions, curtailing participation, delegitimising opposition","Tensions concerning environmental governance have increased in Brazil since the far-right came to power in 2016. We offer insight into this process by analysing the first two years of Jair Bolsonaro's (2019-ongoing) environmental policies-namely, how Brazil's environmental protection arrangements are being dismantled. We find that the Bolsonaro administration centralises environmental governance in Brazil through complementary authoritarian and populist means. First in restricting participatory decision-making spaces such as the National Environmental Council (Conama) and the National Council of the Legal Amazon (CNAL), and, second, by attacking indigenous and traditional peoples, NGOs, scientists, and other environmental defenders. To illustrate the authoritarian dimension of Bolsonaro's environmental governance, we carry out a political-institutional analysis of contemporary Brazilian environmental politics and then exemplify the ways and extent to which attacks against environmental defenders is a constituent part of Bolsonaro's environmental populism. We hold that such attacks are not merely rhetorical but a political tactic to legitimise Bolsonaro's authoritarian environmental governance in the promotion of 'total extractivism' while maintaining a populist appeal.",Multi-Theme
22,23,"Institutions, Networks and Activism Inside the State: Women's Health and Environmental Policy in Brazil","This article examines institutional activism between 2011 and 2018 in two Brazilian government programs, 'Green Grants' and the 'Stork Network'. Institutional activism is defined as collective action in the defense of contentious causes conducted within the boundaries of state institutions. The two policies were designed and implemented by bureaucrats committed to social movement causes, environmentalism and women's health, respectively. The environmentalist bureaucrats were mostly permanent public employees with few ties to movement networks, while the women's health group included mostly temporary employees with long histories of civil society activism. I argue that diverse locations in state institutions and movement networks gave these groups access to different combinations of institutional and relational resources. In dialogue with theories of situated agency and activist strategy, I show how those differences both led actors to engage in different kinds of strategies and influenced the way those strategies changed as political conditions became increasingly hostile.",Energy Transition
23,24,Political-relational capacity building for federative coordination in the Water for All Program: analysis from the neoinstitutionalist perspective,"Research objective: To analyze the differences in trajectories in the construction of relational capacities existing in the two main partner organizations in the execution of the Water for All Program (APT), and their relationship in the institutional arrangement for federative coordination. Theoretical framework: The theoretical approach of historical neoinstitutionalism was used in order to contribute to the understanding of how the institutional arrangements of federative coordination are organized and related in the construction of political-relational capacities in a complex public policy. Methodology: The qualitative research used data sources such as bibliographic and documentary survey, in addition to the participant observation technique. This is a case study. The data obtained were analyzed using the content analysis technique. The analytical categories used were intersectoral, federative relations, social participation and territoriality. Results: The Ministry of National Integration (MI) and the Ministry of Social Development and Fight against Hunger (MDS), had trajectories of building different relational capacities, as can be seen in the formation of the respective institutional arrangements for federative coordination and in relation to the society. Unlike the MI, there was an institutional change in social policy under the responsibility of the MDS, with the critical moment being the institutionalization of the Unified Social Assistance System (SUAS) with federative coordination mechanisms and a continuous flow of resources. Positive and learning policy feedback occurred in the federative relationship and with civil society. Originality: The analysis of the national experience of the past twenty years on the topic of coordination still has gaps. Considering the different analytical dimensions together, it allowed us to understand the specifics of each institutional arrangement and the extent to which they advance in terms of coordinating different actors in the decision-making processes. Theoretical and practical contributions:This work contributed to a better understanding of the challenges of federative coordination of intersectoral public policies to combat poverty in a complex institutional environment. The research also adds to the knowledge base of the literature on institutional arrangements by bringing the case study of a program linked to Regional Policy in Brazil, until then little studied under this theoretical approach.",Freshwater Governance

The article contributes to the debate on institutional innovation processes in mining contexts, but focuses on an underexplored aspect, social institutional innovations and their connection with the lack of legitimacy of state environmental institutions. The analysis shows that through a process of re-politicization of pre-existing instruments, community actors design and implement alternative schemes for environmental control.",Mining
25,26,The politics of climate policy innovation: the case of the Argentine carbon tax,"This contribution analyzes the policymaking process of the carbon tax in Argentina based on the multiple streams approach (MSA). The study shows how policy entrepreneurs took advantage of a general tax reform bill to promote the idea of a carbon tax. Mainly driven by international emulation and reputational gains concerns, the carbon tax proposal successfully advanced through the government ' s internal drafting process of the Tax Reform Bill, however, it faced strong opposition during the legislative decision-making process, which resulted in the adoption of a weaker carbon tax. From a climate politics perspective, the Argentine carbon tax case suggests the political limitations of an over-reliance on international reputation arguments to advance climate policy innovation. In relation to the MSA, the study highlights how policy windows can shape processes of policy innovation and the analytical convenience of differentiating the coupling processes between the agenda-setting and decision-making stages.",Climate Change
26,27,AMLO's populism in Mexico and the framing of the extractivist agenda: The construction of the hegemony of the people without the indigenous voices,"In Latin America, the relationship between populism and environmentalism is intrinsically linked to extractivism. The commodities boom that the region experienced during the early 2000s was accompanied by the resurgence of populism in the region and the emergence of socio-environmental conflicts led by indigenous environmental movements. Despite the fact that Latin American populism supposedly represents unprotected groups, there has been a general failure on the part of these governments to incorporate the visions and demands of the indigenous peoples. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) assumed Mexico's presidency in 2018. In this context, his reliance on extractive industries as a lever for socioeconomic development and criticism towards neoliberalism has led many analysts to place him under the populist umbrella. AMLO has developed a discursive strategy consisting of dividing the political field into two antagonistic parts: 'the people', whose demands and interests are supposedly defended by his popular project and 'the conservatives', the corrupt elite. This article explores the way in which AMLO has reacted to the indigenous environmental movements and his discursive strategies to face the contradiction of constructing the hegemony of the people without incorporating indigenous voices. The article develops a frame analysis applied to AMLO's discourse on a large-scale energy project: Proyecto Integral Morelos (PIM). It concludes that, as with other populists in the region, AMLO has been shown to be incapable of articulating the indigenous environmental opposition into his national project.",Energy Transition

28,29,Ecologists by default? How the indigenous movement in Ecuador became protector of nature,"Since several decades, indigenous peoples are seen as stewards of nature. This is not only an attribution by Western/Northern academics but rather the result of conscious political choices undertaken by organizations related to those peoples. From a certain moment on, some indigenous organizations integrated nature-related contents into their functioning and demands. In the Ecuadorian case, it is easily traceable when ecology entered the discourse of the indigenous movement and how it developed. Ecology and its connection to well-known concepts such as Buen Vivir/Sumak Kawsay is a main reasons for the success of the movement. This article will analyse the ecologization of the movement and its discourse as a particularly effective way of self-inclusion of the excluded and the subsequent institutionalization both on the level of organizations and the level of discourse. This will make possible to understand the moment of main impact of ecological contents–for instance in the 1990s–and demands and the moments of systematic depoliticization of those demands–especially, since 2008. © 2019, © 2019 The European Association for the Advancement of the Social Sciences.",Forests and Land Use
29,30,The politics of environmental market instruments: Coalition building and knowledge filtering in the regulation of forest certificates trading in Brazil,"Market instruments for environmental governance have a foundation in an economic theorythat claims to be universal and atemporal, but their materialization in practice always takes place in specific socioeconomic and political contexts. The Brazilian trade in forest certificates (CRA) is a new market instrument that allows farmers that have deforested illegally prior to 2008 to become compliant by acquiring certificates from other farmers that conserve a forest area beyond legal requirements. Even though the CRA market has been praised as an innovative environmental policy, it is still unclear whether it will be implemented even after more than two decades of political debate, congressional approval of legislation and substantial investments in new supporting systems. This research paper aims to analyze the materialization of this market by reconstructing how policy participants form advocacy coalitions (i.e. environmental protection, market viability and agricultural consolidation) to advance their interests. Our results show that advocacy coalitions filter (i.e. absorb, reject or transform) new ideas, experiences and knowledge in order to influence the regulations for forest certificate trading. In doing so, they often combine positions, form new alliances and merge with other advocacy coalitions in accordance with the interests of their constituents. These fluid allegiances within and between coalitions explain why market materialization remains ambiguous and unlikely to become operational in the near future. ",Forests and Land Use

The speech extracts were categorized according to the modes of operation of ideology and typical strategies of symbolic construction proposed by Thompson (1995). Findings - The results suggest that the discourse can be an instrument of internal coordination and between coalitions that share beliefs about a policy, as in the case of Belo Monte. Potentially existing coalitions define their identities and set positions on controversial issues, aligning interests and expectations. In the case studied, the modes of operation of ideology verified as instruments of the coalitions were dissimulation, reification, fragmentation, unification and legitimation. Research limitations/implications - The paper represents a unique analysis of the modes of operation of ideology (Thompson, 1999) in the case of Belo Monte. In addition, the paper aims to contribute to the New Discursive Institutionalism and to the ACF when it uses the critical discourse analysis to articulate a method to analyze the use of the Discourse by the coalitions. In fact, such an approach integrating the ACF, the New Discursive Institutionalism and the critical discourse analysis is something original. Finally, it also addresses a gap in ACF: issues related to advocacy coalition coordination. Practical implications - Attentive readers linked to organizations working on infrastructure and environmental policies can benefit from the results by envisaging the deliberate manipulation of typical symbolic construction strategies and general modes of operation of ideology. Social implications - The study sheds light on the daily and behind-the-scenes disputes among stakeholders who are interested in a certain public policy. It may draw attention to the acres and professional use of the shorthand notes of the hearings held at the National Congress. Originality/value - This paper aims to fill a gap pointed out by Jenkins-Smith et al (2014) regarding problems of coordination of advocacy coalitions. In addition, it innovates by using critical discourse analysis as a methodological reference in ACF empirical studies. In addition. this work continues a trajectory of two other previously published studies dealing with the same phenomenon: a theoretical essay and a case study.",Forests and Land Use
31,32,A Comparative Study of the Introduction of Restrictions to Large-Scale Mining in Four Latin American Countries,"Institutions are important to enhance the contribution of mining industries not only to economic growth, but also to environmental justice and equality. In this paper, we study the processes by which four Latin American countries modified their existing institutions to manage the effects or large-scale mining in their territories. We focus on the political struggles to introduce legislation to restrict the geographical expansion of large-scale mining in their territories. To this end, we integrate a leading theory of the policy process with theoretical insights from studies of environmental governance and political settlements. Our findings show that processes of policy change followed distinct paths with common elements. The elements that link the initial conditions with change are policy learning, challenges to dominant policy images, conflict expansion, and the involvement of veto players. We also observe that the outputs of the reforms diverge significantly. Three contextual variables contributed to the variability of the outputs of these reforms; the degree of cohesion of elites, the degree of development of environmental institutions, and the relative dependency on mineral revenues. During the processes of policy making, these institutions offered different opportunities and constraints for policy challengers to advance their agenda and for dominant actors to maintain the status quo. The new policy designs offer opportunities for countries to deal with the effects of mining on sensitive ecosystems but political instability threatens the long-term institutionalization of these reforms.",Mining
32,33,Large-scale environmental policy change: analysis of the Brazilian reality,"The Brazilian presidential elections of 2018 brought large-scale changes in the Brazilian environmental policy subsystem. The purpose of this article is to analyze these changes through the lenses of the Advocacy Coalition Framework - ACF. First, we introduced some of the main characteristics of this subsystem, then we presented a hemerographic analysis to describe and analyze the effects of four recent shocks in this subsystem. Two of these shocks were external: (i) the election of a new political elite in power that brought a clear discourse of denial of the relevance of environmental policy and (ii) calamitous environmental events that occurred in Brazil in 2019. The other two shocks were internal: (i) the capture of key positions and resources by dominant coalition members and (ii) the rise of conflict and polarization among the coalitions in the subsystem. The results showed: (i) the rise of a hyper-adversarial environmental policy subsystem; (ii) a realignment between non-dominant coalitions in a cooperative direction; (iii) the imposition of clear barriers to negotiation; (iv) changes in the use of scientific information by more politicized discourses with a high degree of bias. The article contributes to the understanding of the processes of institutional change in environmental policy, especially in contexts of large-scale change generated by increasing electoral polarization and fierce political disputes. It also contributes to the analysis of the limits and possibilities of the ACF in the Brazilian environmental agenda.",Multi-Theme
33,34,Contingent Coalitions in Environmental Policymaking: How Civil Society Organizations Influenced the Chilean Renewable Energy Boom,"This article analyzes the role of social movements and environmental organizations in crafting contingent coalitions to advance renewable energies in Chile. Until recently, Chile presented several conditions predicting the continuation of an arm's-length energy policy and a deregulated energy market heavily concentrated on environmentally and socially unfriendly sources. However, gradual but transformative policy change in the last decade has made the country a world leader in renewable energy development. Studying two key moments in energy policy reform, we argue that the contingency of the coalitions that social movements and environmental organizations forged was crucial to the advancement of renewable energy policy and the transformation of the energy sector in the country. The paper advances our understanding of policy change in contexts of high path dependency and status quo bias, and builds the concept of contingent coalitions, unifying similar but scattered and under-theorized notions that capture the fluid dynamics of coalition formation and policy change in environmental policymaking.",Energy Transition
34,35,Climate change policy networks: connecting adaptation and mitigation in multiplex networks in Peru,"Increasing attention is being given to integrating adaptation and mitigation in climate change policies. Policy network analysis is a way to explore connections between adaptation and mitigation, and the opportunities or barriers to effective integration between these two policy subdomains. This study explores climate governance and policy networks by examining collaboration and information flows in national policy processes in Peru, a country with an active climate change policy domain. In contrast to most climate policy network analyses, this study distinguishes adaptation and mitigation subdomains through a multiplex approach. We used ERGM (Exponential Random Graph Models) to explain the existence of information flows and collaborations among 76 key actors in climate change policy in Peru. We identified actors who could connect adaptation and mitigation subdomains. Results show a concentration of influence in national government actors, particularly in the mitigation subdomain, and the isolation of actor groups that matter for policy implementation, such as the private sector or subnational actors. Results highlight the predominance of mitigation over adaptation and the existence of actors well positioned to broker relationships between the subdomains. The top brokers across subdomains were, however, not only actors with high centrality and brokerage roles in the subdomains, but also several 'unusual key players' that were not brokers in any of the two layers separately. Key policy insights National government institutions are central actors in climate change policy networks in Peru, reflecting national ownership of the climate change issue. Private sector organizations and subnational actors in Peru are the least involved in information sharing and collaboration on climate change. Actors from different levels and sectors are active in both adaptation and mitigation, which is good for climate policy integration. Actors with the capacity to bridge the two policy subdomains are not necessarily central to each subdomain but may be actors that close structural holes between subdomains.",Climate Change

Una aproximación al diseño institucional desde el marco de análisis y desarrollo institucional,"Gold rising prices at the dawn of the 21st Century have led to a gold rush in Colombia. However, most of the mining in the national territory is made without the minimum legal permits required. Informal gold mining is associated with multiple problems such as resource overuse, environmental externalities, illegal armed groups financing, among others. Thus, public policy as a discipline is called to promote adequate mechanisms for mining formalization. The article depicts an integral implementation of the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework (IAD) (universal interaction blocks, ADICO syntax, generic rule typology) in analysing, from an institutional design perspective, the context of the Special Reserves Areas in Antioquia’s Bajo Cauca. The analysis highlights the utility of the IAD framework for diagnosis and public policy design, and the difficulties that arise from the context and the legal arrangement in trying to use the Special Reserves Areas as an instrument for formalization in the Bajo Cauca.",Mining

Through a qualitative research methodology and based on the Institutional Analysis and Development Framework (IAD), the article establishes that even if constitutional rules determine the formulation of Land Use Plans (POT), these rules present a gap, in which local actors develop strategies to modify them. As a conclusion, the study states that, in this process, the participants develop incremental learning in which they manage to modify the rules, sometimes from a short-term perspective and favoring particular or reduced interests, and sometimes with a longer-term vision according to values and in benefit of nature and future generations. In each case, the capacity for collective action is decisive.",Forests and Land Use

Because of the limits to the model proposed by cognitive theories, the article shows that this framework can be complemented with the model of institutional change proposed by historical institutionalism theories. Therefore, it centers on the dynamics of change beyond theories based on critical junctures or exogenous shocks, focusing on continuities rather than changes. The study is based on two policy change case studies-tax policy in Brazil, and environmental policies in Chile. We suggest a model that can explain gradual cognitive changes by proposing two different forms of policy change: ideational anchorage and cognitive layering.",Forests and Land Use

The results show that the theme’s ascension to the government agenda stemmed from a conjuncture marked by intense transitions that contributed to opening a policy window. The struggle to guarantee social rights in the Brazilian re-democratization process; the activities of social movements like the grassroots public health movement; the large sanitary deficit and its consequences for public health; the joint involvement of institutions with considerable expertise like Economic and Social Planning Institute (IPEA), Public Health Special Service Foundation (FSESP) and Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) and the availability of financial resources stemming from a partnership arrangement with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) provided a favorable environment for the elaboration of the PNSR.",Multi-Theme

40,41,Between the Global Commodity Boom and Subnational State Capacities: Payment for Environmental Services to Fight Deforestation in Argentina,"Does subnational state capacity stop deforestation? The commodity boom of the 2000s significantly expanded the agriculture frontier in most provinces of Argentina, with devastating effects on native forests. Interestingly, some of the subnational governments that presided over the commodities supercycle also sought to reform the forestry sector to reduce rampant deforestation, despite promoting and benefiting from agricultural expansion. A national program to protect native forests through payment for environmental services (PES) was created to be implemented in local districts. We argue that the success of new forest protections is contingent on the capacity of subnational governments to implement the law. In our study, we find that changes in provincial deforestation rates are explained by the interaction of state capacity, on one hand, and high land prices driven by commodity pressures, on the other. Our research carries implications for students and practitioners of forest PES. Our findings underscore the fundamental role subnational state governments play in climate change mitigation and adaptation.",Climate Change

This article analyzes the representations of water and gold, and the superposition of the territorialities of the different social groups (Santurban population, Bucaramanga population, foreign company, and State) in 2011 as an effect of the socio-environmental conflict over industrial mining in the moor. To do this, the researchers carried out an exercise in narrative interpretation of semi-structured interviews with residents and social groups in the municipalities of Vetas, California, and the city of Bucaramanga, who argue the importance of water and gold in their daily lives. The population of Santurbán conceives water as fundamental for its existence and the gold for its economy, traditions, and culture. Meanwhile, for the population of Bucaramanga, the representation of water is related to environmental ethics. This overlap triggers previously invisible conflicts between two neighboring populations that have jointly benefited from the moorland. © Jungseok Research Institute of International Logistics and Trade.

Given the lack of studies on the impacts of oil palm on these populations, this study analyzed the socio-environmental impacts perceived by the Tembé, in Tomé-Açu, Pará State. With an interdisciplinary approach, between 2016 and 2017, semi-structured interviews and participant observation were conducted in five villages, inside and adjacent to the Turé-Mariquita Indigenous Land and complemented by remote sensing analyzes. This article describes the pressure vectors and the main socio-environmental impacts through the analysis of the indigenous narrative, and then these are discussed based on the scientific literature and remote sensing data. The findings indicate that the conversion of the surrounding territory to oil palm monoculture generated social and environmental changes that negatively affected the Tembé’s way of life and their capacity of socio-cultural reproduction. © 2020.

43,44,Extraction and development: fossil fuel production narratives and counternarratives in Colombia,"Colombia, a country that is very vulnerable to climate change, has played a positive role in international climate negotiations. Paradoxically, Colombia is also the sixth largest coal exporter globally, and its government has adopted policies to further increase the country's production of coal and other fossil fuels. This article explores to what extent the national government reproduces a powerful paradigm - namely, that fossil fuel extraction is necessary for development - and how this resonates at the sub-national level. We find that the government's narrative has evolved to accommodate Colombia's changing national circumstances and public criticism. Though counternarratives exist, they have struggled to propose credible nationwide alternatives to extractive-based development, thus reinforcing the belief that extraction-based development is unavoidable. We describe how government narratives constitute an obstacle to both supply-side policies to restrict fossil fuel development and to transitional assistance policies to adjust to shifts in the global coal market. Key policy insights The view that fossil fuel extraction is necessary for development is a powerful barrier to supply - side climate policy. This view also hinders the formulation of transitional assistance policy. Empirical evidence that fossil fuel extraction seldom leads to equitable development is not enough to overcome this view. Narratives on fossil fuel-based development continuously adjust to prevailing economic development paradigms and contemporary development challenges.",Climate Change

Debating theoretical issues regarding ethics, sociability andsocial conflicts, we base ourselves on the narratives of rural workers, rural producers, gold prospectors, timber merchants and traders about their life stories and the protestin order to argue that they share values and reflect ethically on the relations of domination with the government and between themselves.

When the Workers' Party first took office in 2003, many social movement actors joined the government, especially in that agency. After 2007, however, most of these activists left the government. At the same time, the ministry substituted thousands of temporary employees for permanent civil servants. Surprisingly, this study finds that these public employees carried forward the environmentalist cause, even when this required contesting the priorities of superiors. Examining their attitudes and practices leads to a definition of activism as the proactive pursuit of opportunities to defend contentious causes. The case study helps to develop this concept and to demonstrate that workers inside bureaucracies can engage in activist behavior.

This network originated from the Campaign `Y Ikatu Xingu, a social phenomenon concerning conservation and protection of the Xingu spring region. The river basin of the Xingu headwaters, 17 million hectares, is the main focus of XSN and it has lost five million hectares of forests and cerrados, which were converted into grain monoculture fields, within a very short period of time. The impact on the quality of the river water caused an environmental and health problem for the indigenous peoples of the indigenous lands. XSN has promoted innovative technological alternatives for recovery of permanent preservation areas (PPAs) or gallery forest and income generation for small farmers and local communities. The goal of this study is to analyze the environmental governance in the Xingu basin, paying particular attention to institutional arrangements of the Xingu Seeds Network. This analysis is grounded on the theoretical-methodological framework, contained in the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD), which offers tools for understanding the strengthening process of democratic institutions in the protection of common-pool resources.

Thus, for environmental politics, Conservation Unities (UCs) of full protection guarantee the conservation of biodiversity, though there is still no recognition of the important role of local communities in the sustainable management of resources in the process of environmental management and biodiversity conservation. Therefore, the aim of this work was to comprehend the environmental perception of the rural community of Barrocão (Uruçuca-BA) located in the surroundings of the State Park of Serra do Conduru (PESC), identifying the type of relationship stablished between the community and PESC. The study is a qualitative-quantitative research, with phenomenology as its theoretical-methodological matrix. The data was collected using semi-structured interviews with 13 members of the community association Doces e Segredos da Floresta, starting from an itinerary elaborated following the methodological orientations of the environmental perception of Whyte (1977). The analysis showed a distancing between the management of the PESC and the local community, evidencing the absence of the participation of the residents in the processes of creation and management of the UC. Although they establish a conflict relationship with the unit, the residents recognize the park's function and consider it important in the conservation of the environment. © 2019 Centro Universitario de Anapolis.

51,52,From frontier governance to governance frontier: The political geography of Brazil's Amazon transition,"The ‘frontier’ is central to a new wave of development scholarship, but the broad deployment of the concept has blurred several key dimensions of frontier development. We focus on the Brazilian Amazon to synthesize classical frontier theory and emerging perspectives with special attention to the role of governance in frontier development. Since 2004, primary deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has declined over 70 percent while agricultural production in the region has increased. Contrary to narratives that view this transition as the result of ‘frontier governance’ – i.e., the imposition of order on a pre-existing frontier – we propose the concept of a ‘governance frontier,’ which recognizes the role of politics in constructing and transforming frontier spaces. This concept politicizes economic accounts of frontier development and spatializes   notions of governance. We employ a ‘follow the policy’ methodology to trace the evolution of a governance frontier in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, drawing on original fieldwork across four Amazonian municipalities and inside an environmental non-governmental organization. We show that a key feature of the Amazonian governance frontier has been a distinct geographical configuration of ‘model municipalities’ that function as nodes of policy experimentation, legitimation, and transfer. Our findings support an integration of frontier theory and governance theory in a place-based, political geography approach to regional political-economic transformation, which demands greater attention to the political dimensions of frontiers and to the spatial dimensions of governance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Forests and Land Use
52,53,"(Re)thinking (re)connection: Young people, “natures” and the water–energy–food nexus in São Paulo State, Brazil","This paper critically analyses pervasive contemporary discourses that call for children and young people to be “reconnected” with nature and natural resources. Simultaneously, it reflects on emerging forms of nexus thinking and policy that seek to identify and govern connections between diverse sectors, and especially water, energy and food. Both of these fields of scholarship are concerned with connections, of different kinds, and at different spatial scales. Based on a large-scale, mixed-method research project in São Paulo State, Brazil, this paper explores how these rather different literatures could be combined in order to (re)think notions of (re)connection that operate across different spatial, political and material registers. Through research with Brazilian professionals and young people about their experiences of, and learning about, the water–energy–food nexus, the paper makes several substantive contributions to scholarship on childhood, youth, environmental education and nexus thinking. Centrally, it is argued that, rather than dispense with them, there are manifold possibilities for expanding and complicating notions of (re)connection, which rely on a more nuanced analysis of the logistical, technical, social and political contexts in which nexuses are constituted. Thus, our work flips dominant forms of nexus thinking by privileging a “bottom-up” analysis of (especially) young people's everyday, embodied engagements with water, food and energy. Our resultant findings indicated that young people are “connected” with natures and with the water–energy–food nexus, in both fairly conventional ways and in ways that significantly extend beyond contemporary discourses about childhoods–natures (and particularly in articulating the importance of care and community). Consequently, the nexus approach that is advocated in this paper could enable more nuanced, politically aware conceptualisations of (re)connection, both within and beyond scholarship on childhoods–natures and nexus thinking.

Brazil produced 14.8 GW of wind powered energy in 2019, 85.7% of this total in the Northeastern region. Social and environmental fragilities of local communities, overlooked an exclusionary planning, have led to opposition movements against wind farm implementation. This study aims to assess how the arrival of wind power dialogues with the demands of the communities living in the projects' vicinities, as well as repercussions on institutional, socio-economic and environmental developments. A case study was conducted with regard to the Galinhos' community reaction to the arrival of wind power. First, public domain narratives were evaluated, in order to ascertain the different perceptions from the social actors involved in the process. Next, the community's vision was assessed regarding expectations and fears, created by the existence of the wind farm, before and after its implementation. The perception was that the wind farm did not change the population's socioeconomic conditions and environmental issues require appraisals by the accountable bodies. In this scenario, the materiality of the narrative that justifies wind farm expansion in the Brazilian northeast was assessed. © 2019 by the authors.",Energy Transition

The mobilization of identity has been a main strategy of the inhabitants of the Lacandon Community Zone and the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve for maintaining their access to natural resources and benefitting from conservation. In the Lacandon Rainforest, conservation comes at great cost to the local population but, at the same time, offers an opportunity to access monetary and political resources. Because of this tension, the peasants build complex and fractured identities, in an iterative process, assuming different images as they struggle to reconcile their personal desires with the external plan to preserve the forest.

56,57,How Do States Benefit from Nonstate Governance? Evidence from Forest Sustainability Certification,"Forest sustainability certification is emblematic of governance mechanisms associated with neoliberal state reforms. Despite being conceived as a means of compensating for the unwillingness or inability of states to regulate forest practices, in practice, forest certification has come to entail complex and hybrid relationships between private-sector, civil society, and government actors. Indeed, states have increasingly embraced certification as a means of complementing or even supplanting traditional forms of governmental regulation of the forest sector. Yet processes of neoliberalization imply both an expansion of opportunities for hybrid governance and a weakening of the state capacity that is often needed for successful implementation of certification initiatives. We analyze the complex relationships between neoliberalization, state capacity, and certification through two contrasting cases in Wisconsin, United States, and Entre Rios, Argentina. Our findings illustrate the tensions within broadly neoliberal and postneoliberal regimes and highlight the persistence of long-standing patterns of state-led environmental governance.",Multi-Theme

Recently, several disciplines have converged on the socioecosystem (SES) concept as an ideal theoretical framework for managing integrated social and natural systems for their sustainable development, and its rapid incorporation into environmental public policy is sought. A consultation was undertaken to gauge the expert opinion of Mexico’s federal environment sector officials with regard to the SES approach and its potential as a new basis for public policy. The results demonstrate that although the experts are unfamiliar with the SES approach, they value the policy attributes which characterize it, indicating that if these were fully incorporated into current policies, they could help correct their deficiencies. A majority of experts consider the more integral SES approach offers advantages, and it is concluded that these key actors are receptive to the approach and its possible adoption.",Forests and Land Use

In this context, we identified not only the specific measures applied by governmental institutions and their impacts, but also other crucial political, socioeconomic, and environmental factors, which determined the scale and spatial extension of ecosystem degradation. As a result, public policies lacking environmental integration, particularly stream straightening and incentives to promote the production of biofuel made form African oil palms, were the decisive triggers, but not the sole agents of mangroves’ degradation.

59,60,Challenges for sustainable development in Brazilian Amazonia,"Most economic initiatives and infrastructure projects in Brazilian Amazonia have social benefits that are small and ephemeral, while their socioenvironmental impacts are severe. More sustainable forms of development are inhibited by barriers such as a decision-making system with heavy influence (including corruption) from actors with interests in nonsustainable activities. These interests have driven a recent surge of legislative threats to environmental licensing. Better alternatives exist for many destructive forms of “development” projects. Examples include transport using rivers (rather than building highways) and electricity generation from Brazil's vast solar and wind resources (rather than hydroelectric dams). Traditional rural populations could receive support from programs that tap the value of the Amazon forest's environmental services, but institutional mechanisms are in their infancy, among challenges that include differing political interests of countries providing environmental services and those that might pay for them, lack of data and a “theoretical battlefield” regarding accounting for benefits.

61,62,Institutions and environmental governance: The case of environmental permitting for offshore oil and gas projects,"This work is an effort to link institutions and environmental governance, focusing on the Brazilian offshore oil and gas sector. A case study detailing the experience of an environmental unit of Brazil`s federal environmental agency (Coordenação Geral de Petróleo e Gás, Diretoria de Licenciamento, Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis - CGPEG/DILIC/IBAMA) is used for this purpose. This unit is in charge of handling environmental permits for projects in this area. The methodology follows the institutional analysis and development framework as described by Ostrom (2011). Results reveal an environmental governance system characterized by the lack of policies that complement the issuing of environmental permits. In addition, we describe the institutional environment at CGPEG, demonstrating the existence of trust among its personnel. Finally, our conclusions indicate the importance of ensuring the permanence of the public staff, as well as the need to structure strategic governance systems.",Energy Transition
62,63,Water Governance and Emerging Challenges for Rigid Normative and Institutional Structures: an Analysis from the Chilean Case,"In recent years there has been a decrease in water availability mainly associated to climate change and a strong increase in the demand for this resource. As a consequence, the water sector is facing increasing pressures at the social, economic, environmental and political levels. This new scenario generates high levels of uncertainty that increase tensions over the access to water. The diverse valuations and uses given by the multiple stake-holders interested in this resource make traditional management and governance models based on the theory ofcommand and control inadequate. This paper theoretically analyzes different conceptions and models of water governance, their characteristics, levels and scales of operation, identifying potentials and limitations to face complex and dynamic contexts. At the empirical level the Chilean case is explored since there is a water market for this resource allocation. To develop the analytical framework on the concept of water governance, a compilation and selection (directed review of literature) of recent research on the subject was carried out by consulting scientific articles published in internationally recognized journals and with high impact in the area of social sciences, interdisciplinary and water resources. The results show that a rigid, centralized system with legislation that prioritizes private interests before public interests causes inequity in access to water and needs a change in its structure that allow it to face the new conditions of dynamic and complex systems. On the other hand, the concept of water governance must be addressed as a socio-ecological system and it is not pertinent to analyze the water system in isolation. The model of adaptive governance emerges as the most propitious to face changing conditions, although its implementation presents several challenges. Finally, some initiatives are shown at a local scale that are emerging in Chile and that stand out as an advance in the transition from a traditional governance model to an adaptive one.",Climate Change
63,64,Re-politicizing participation or reframing environmental governance? Beyond indigenous’ prior consultation and citizen participation,"Recent studies explore how participatory mechanisms such as prior consultation/consent processes and participation in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) might reinforce the mediating role of the state between social groups and companies at the same time that creates political opportunities for promoting social demands. This article problematizes these ideas by deepening the understanding of participatory mechanisms within broader environmental governance structures. The focus of the article is Peru, the first Latin American country that has passed a General Law of prior consultation for indigenous peoples, and currently is struggling to articulate this mechanism to participatory stages in EIAs. From an engagement with the literature on political ecology and development studies, this article explores the limitations of indigenous participation within an environmental governance that prioritize the promotion of investments in extractive industries. In particular, by exploring the challenges and limitations of indigenous decision-making power in new institutions for consultation and EIA participation, the article holds that participatory mechanisms themselves are unable to provide more power of decision to indigenous peoples if policy-makers translate claims for institutional transformation (related to indigenous self-determination and ecological zoning) into merely participatory provisions of specific projects. The result is a paradoxical multiplication of weak participatory channels, making the voices of local communities and indigenous peoples auditable, however, without a real compromise to translate these concerns into public policies beyond participatory processes. This study is a qualitative investigation whose data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, observation and documentary analysis. The author undertook 38 semi-structured interviews in 2016–2017 with key relevant actors (from state offices, indigenous organizations, and civil society organizations) involved in consultation processes and participation in EIAs, and documentary analysis of EIAs, reports, legal regulations and policy instruments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Forests and Land Use

We analyze the causes and consequences of the institutional changes that occurred as well as the actors involved and their beliefs addressed to public policy. The research is a qualitative study and has used data collected from an extensive set of documents related to the legislative process and interviews with key actors involved in the public policy in focus. Five advocacy coalitions acting in decision-making arenas on this issue were identified: modernists, developmentalists, social housing coalition, environmentalists and patrimonialists. It is verified that the institutional changes in the last two decades were held by the government under strong pressure of historically hegemonic coalitions. Additionally, we apply the research findings to ongoing debates in the Legislative Chamber of the Federal District, in late 2013, on the Plan for the Preservation of Brasilia Original Plan (PPCUB) and the new Land Use Law (Luos).",Multi-Theme
65,66,"UN environmental policy: Non-State Actors, trends, and the regulatory role of the state","This interdisciplinary article draws from the radical ideas of global political ecology (GPE), environmental politics, ecological economics and the sociological analysis of social movements. It seeks to help bridge the research gap regarding non-state actors' (NSAs) influence on the role of the nation-state and the United Nations in global political ecology and environmental policy, including emission reductions, such as anti-deforestation measures, and environmental justice. We consider NSAs as consisting of two heterogeneous global coalitions: a) civil society organizations (CSOs) and environmental non-governmental organizations, and b) peak corporate organizations with green economy objectives, here denominated green business organizations, representing transnational corporations (TNCs). After a review of prior studies, we present a version of an advocacy coalition framework; identify a timeline of changes in UN architecture and simplified NSA influence categories. We only begin to test very broad hypotheses on relative agency and to compare NSA narratives with UN documents. We show that the architecture of the UN has gradually shifted from favoring civil society to corporations. There is evidence that, in the late 1990s, in comparison with CSOs, TNCs increased their access to nation-states and UN agencies. The TNC narrative changed from a) denying climate change and ignoring the UN to b) recognizing change and guiding negotiations. These shifts in UN architecture, TNC agency and narrative appears to have influenced changes in UN documents towards a corporate global environmental framework, reducing their references to the regulatory and enforcement roles of the state and global binding agreements, shifting global debate towards a voluntary corporate orientation. This may have reduced prospects for reducing emissions and increasing environmental justice. Combining market mechanisms with strong regulatory frameworks is best practice for environmental policy. When nation-states have the will and capacity to command and control, they can reduce environmental degradation. Stronger national government competence and enforcement capacity and binding UN agreements are essential for the effectiveness of market incentives, which may be enhanced by business and civil society initiatives. If CSOs can reunite and regain their strength, maybe they could negotiate with TNCs on a more equal footing. Perhaps UN members could once again become comfortable with the idea of strong states and non-hegemonic global governance. © 2020, University of Arizona Libraries.",Multi-Theme
66,67,Payments for Ecosystem Services as a Policy Mix: Demonstrating the institutional analysis and development framework on conservation policy instruments,"Policy mix analysis has been applied in research on energy, climate, urban and transport policy, and more recently biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. However, policy mix analysis has thus far been employed at a high conceptual level, focusing on describing interactions between instrument types. Policy mix analysis rarely describes instrument ‘structure’ or functional characteristics in a way that would answer the question ‘what constitutes an instrument’? We describe how the rules-in-use taxonomy of the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, developed for research on common pool resource management, can be used to characterize conservation policy instrument interactions. We demonstrate the approach on the well-known payments for ecosystem services (PES) program in Costa Rica and cross-compliance policies, arguing that PES is a policy mix rather than a single economic instrument. Our analysis shows how design features of PES described in the economics literature map to ‘rules-in-use’ in the IAD framework. The framework provides a terminology for defining what constitutes institutional context, comparing economic, regulatory and information instruments, and studying their interactions. The rules-in-use taxonomy of IAD is a ‘structural’ diagnostic approach, which needs to be combined with other tools that analyse the role and ‘agency’ of actors, as part of integrative environmental governance research.",Biodiversity Conservation
67,68,Simulating land use changes under alternative policy scenarios for conservation of native forests in south-central Chile,"In this study, we combined policy analysis with landscape change modeling to simulate outcomes of alternative forest conservation instruments proposed by opposing policy coalitions. In 1992, concern over rapid land conversion to timber plantations (Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp.) in Chile gave rise to a protracted policy process resulting in the 2008 Native Forest Law (NFL), which subsidizes reforestation and management with native forest. To date, however, NFL has had little impact on native forest conservation. To understand how the policy process that created the NFL shaped its outcomes, we employed the Dyna-CLUE modeling approach to simulate land use changes in south-central Chile from 1993 to 2007, based on 3 scenarios: (1) enactment of NFL in 1993 when the law was originally debated, and the different configurations of subsidies and regulations proposed in the NFL policy debate by (2) the industrial forestry coalition and (3) the forest conservation coalition. We observed no major difference in native forest loss between simulated outcomes of the industry-advocated policy and the actual NFL legislation. The conservation coalition's policy scenario increased native forest area, primarily in shrub steppe areas, but also via conversion of pine plantations if incentive payments were large enough. However, NFL payments are inadequate to make native forest management a viable economic land use alternative to industrial pine plantations, which are also subsidized in Chile. Gains in native forest cover occurred mostly on lands under ancestral indigenous claims (unrelated to the discussion of the NFL). We conclude that the NFL, even if enacted in 1993, would have been ineffective in preventing native forest loss, because tree plantations are more profitable and NFL regulations were weakened by the industrial coalition that opposed-and strongly shaped-the final legislation. Effective incentives for protecting early-successional forests and shrublands are needed to mitigate further losses and foster recovery of Chile's native forests.",Forests and Land Use

69,70,A Iniciativa Yasuní-ITT: uma análise a partir do Modelo de Fluxos Múltiplos,"This paper analyzes the Yasuní-ITT Initiative, a proposed environmental and natural resources policy, by which the Ecuadorian government would renounce the exploitation of major oil reserves. It aims at discussing the Initiative as an innovation on the political agenda based on the social construction of oil exploitation in the Ecuadorian Amazon as a public problem, the development of alternative solutions and their government recognition. The research is grounded on the Kingdon's Multiple Streams Model (MSM) in the agenda setting process, from an extensive literature review. The data concerning the Initiative was collected primarily on scientific literature, as well as documents of institutions and organizations involved in its formulation. Although the Initiative has not been implemented, its evolution in the agenda has highlighted the links between local, territorial disputes and national economic issues, the possibility of economic compensation and a moratorium on exploitation, as well as raising questions concerning political legitimacy. These flows’ linkage was possible through a political window centered on climate change and varied agents such as the Presidency, oil companies, NGOs and social movements, as well as international institutions and other governments. The main contributions to the discussion of public policy and agenda setting concern: the relevance of the combination of discourses, moral (biodiversity, human rights and climate change) and economic in this case; the strong correlation between different scales (national and international) in understanding the political flow; and the procedural view of agents in leading flows and policy windows, by changing their relative capabilities of exercising power.",Climate Change
70,71,Behind certification and regulatory processes: Contributions to a political history of the Chilean salmon farming,"This text follows the public regulatory and the private certificatory paths undergone in the last decade by the widely criticized salmon industry in Chile, with the purpose of exploring the political process that underlies this path. The discussion focuses on the several instances in which both industrial actors and oppositional groups have stabilized those conflicts by sitting down at formally established dialogue tables, which, as we will see, have conducted public and private processes of regulation. In particular, we follow two paths: one promoted and overseen by the public sector and the other a process of self-organization and self-control of the industry at the national and global levels, which initially led to processes of self-certification and third-party certification. We argue that it cannot be reduced to an industrial learning due to the economic cost of disease outbreaks but rather that it is the outcome of a contested political process with interplay between global and local actors. This argument challenges the learning narratives espoused by the industry, contributing to a political ecology of certification processes. It analyzes the outcome of this process showing its contested political and social legitimacy, and the interplay between labor and environment within this regulatory path. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Marine/Ocean Governance

The use of water for electricity production in Brazil is a cas d'excellence that exemplifies how the bypassing of socio-environmental safeguards and democratic participation of affected people leads to conflicts. These conflicts delay infrastructure works, such as the Belo Monte Dam, that are found to be crucial for the equilibrium of electricity supply. Recently, social manifestation have become the scapegoat for the sector's crisis. This article discussed the ""electricity crisis"" from a historical policy analysis perspective. It concludes that the present disregard for social and environmental procedures is a self-inflicted disease that only contributes to the longer-term state of conflicts in the expansion of the electricity sector in Brazil.",Freshwater Governance
72,73,"Why were upscaled incentive programs for forest conservation adopted? Comparing policy choices in Brazil, Ecuador, and Peru","Forest conservation policies could potentially become a centerpiece for climate change mitigation. Incentive-based conservation policies, such as payments for environmental services (PES), are seen as promising approaches to reduce deforestation. Yet, arguably the adoption of upscaled PES programs has remained slow, and when implemented their design often diverges from the principles laid out in the theory-based PES literature. In this article, we concentrate on some political economy forces that could help explaining the gap between PES theory and practice, with respect to policy adoption, including opportunities and challenges in this process. Public policy theories grasp the adoption determinants of three large, government-led incentive programs for forest conservation in the Amazon, in Peru, Ecuador, and Brazil. We use Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework to analyze decision-making regarding program initiation, including key stakeholder interviews, to understand policy choices. We find that environmental concerns are not always the prime motives for PES programs, as political and institutional contexts limit environmental policy-makers' actions. Yet, policy choice processes become less constrained when environmental issues are closer to a government's priorities.",Climate Change

A broad view of environmentalist reform in Latin America easily reads as top-down diffusion of blueprints and institutional convergence. But such a thesis is reductionist and ultimately misleading, case studies demonstrate. First, diffusion mechanisms matter for divergence: when normative and mimetic mechanisms are relatively strong vis-à-vis coercive forces, formal state change is followed by more meaningful real state change; when the coercive mechanism rules unmatched, green state change ends up being formal for the most part. Secondly, institutional entrepreneurs face shifting opportunity structures for political change; because these opportunities are never uniform, national experiences will differ. Thirdly, national institutional environments provide contrasting domestic resources and cultures for the building of green states; legacy, in short, will condition translation by entrepreneurs.

77,78,Blame Games in the Amazon: Environmental Crises and the Emergence of a Transparency Regime in Brazil,"Expanding on recent debates in environmental governance and political science, we show that the relationship between environmental transparency and public accountability is far from linear and politically neutral. This is particularly true in moments of environmental crises, when transparency regimes are most likely to emerge as an integral part of the palette of blame-avoidance strategies of accountors in their attempt to disqualify accountees' perceptions of environmental harm and irreparable loss. Drawing upon the study of blame-avoidance strategies in political science, we discuss the emergence and evolution over time of deforestation monitoring in Brazil, a transparency regime based on GIS and remote sensing led by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research since 1989. We arrive at three conclusions. First, the evolution of transparency regimes is conflictual, culturally embedded, and emergent. Second, the relation between accountors and accountees changes over time as blame-avoidance strategies unfold. Finally, solutions in a blame game may cause a future crisis, as the social context changes and becomes incompatible with the transparency regime of the day. Based on these considerations, we argue for the need to understand the instrumental dimension of transparency regimes alongside their normative and substantive dimensions.",Multi-Theme
78,79,New modes of environmental governance in Central America: Constructing a biological corridor policy in Honduras,"New modes of governance, such as network governance or public-private partnership have gained ground in environmental policy. While typically associated with long-term, well-established democracies, these interorganizational processes are emerging in countries with weak democracies such as those in Central America. Scholars on environmental governance are pondering if these new modes of environmental governance make decision-making more inclusive, transparent and accountable, while at the same time promoting effective environmental policy performance. We partially address this question by focusing on public and private actors' articulations of the issue surrounding biological corridors in Honduras. We draw on the institutional analysis framework of policy arrangement developed by Leroy and Ars to provide perspective on the main challenges that network governance confronts in unstable democracies. The case presented here highlights that persistent traditional political forms at the national level hinder network governance. At the same time, emerging collaborative attitudes promoted at local and international level are slowly challenging these traditional forms.",Forests and Land Use
79,80,Movements and the network of environmental justice in Brazil,"This article discusses the development of environmental justice (EJ) in Brazil, particularly since the creation of the Brazilian Network of Environmental Justice (RBJA, by its initials in Portuguese). The RBJA, created in 2002, takes EJ as an integrating and mobilizing concept, because it connects the environmental, social, and ethical dimensions of sustainability and development. Such a concept reduces the fragmentation and isolation existing within several social movements and local communities. I intend to provide some evidence on how RBJA and some social movements are using the concept of EJ in their work, taking as a reference several documents that circulated in the network between 2002 and 2009, as well as the Map of Environmental Injustice and Health in Brazil. The conceptual EJ debate in Brazil has been influenced by social sciences and political ecology, which criticize the capitalistic development model adopted in Brazil that creates social and environmental inequality. EJ arises as a field of reflection and mobilization, and also as a rallying point to identify the struggle of several individuals and entities, such as trade unions, grassroots movements of residents, traditional populations, small agricultures and the landless workers' groups affected by different hazards and risks, environmentalists, and scientists. The RBJA is significantly contributing to spread EJ discussions and mobilizations with different strategies and tools, such as meetings, campaigns, a Web site and an Internet database with EJ documents available. The article ends with some current trends that will probably mobilize the RBJA for the next years. © 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Multi-Theme

We argue that for very large emitters, the climate issue does not evince the 'global commons' logic often attributed to it. Instead, since their actions can directly affect climate outcomes alone or in small groupings, large emitters are more responsive to domestic cost-benefit calculations, making international commitments based on shifting interest group pressures at home.

Literature on the council shows that the presence of specialized knowledge can generate assymetrical power relations among actors, permitting the more skilled sectors control over political and deliberative processes. . This enables us to see how the presence of theoretical knowledge within the councils can lead to their depolitization, demonstrated by the use of technical, scientific, juridical and bureaucratic terms and procedures that empty the councils of their political functions. According to the obstacles we have pointed out, existing literature advocates efforts toward a reduction in technical management in favor of a repolitization of these spaces. . The results of the study we have developed here partially confirm elements present within the literature. Our conclusions indicate that specialized knowledge is an element that is inherent to the functioning of environmental councils. Furthermore, reduction of technical elements may prove harmful in terms of the quality of acts and deliberations that emerge from the Conama, with onus for the legal apparatus of Brazilian environmental legislation and negative impact on the implementation of public policy.",Energy Transition

83,84,INSTITUTIONAL SUBVERSION AND DEFORESTATION: LEARNING LESSONS FROM THE SYSTEM FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL LICENCING OF RURAL PROPERTIES IN MATO GROSSO,"This article contributes to the public administration and environmental governance literature by proposing the notion of institutional subversion as a way of describing how the strategies adopted by local actors may change and even go against the initial aims of institutional development initiatives. The article discusses the case of the system for the environmental licencing of rural properties (SLAPR), an institutional development initiative by the state government of Mato Grosso in the south-eastern portion of the Brazilian Amazon. It will be shown that even though this initiative has earned the status of best practice in controlling deforestation, a closer look at SLAPR reveals that it has led to contradictory outcomes. During the first 8?years of SLAPR, it had no significant impact on reducing deforestation and, in some cases, even permitted the increase of total deforestation by providing authorization for this. According to an institutional analysis of the case study, the article draws particular conclusions that could be relevant to public administrators in the region and in other countries. In particular, it is argued that by accepting the possibility of institutional subversion, public administrators may become more attentive to unexpected consequences and be able to take corrective action. Furthermore, in order to avoid institutional subversion, public administrators should integrate institutional initiatives into broader governmental, technological and economical dimensions.

The theoretical discussion is based on Kingdon´s (1995) multiple streams theory, highlighting its limitations in the analysis of the phenomenon under study. The methodological procedures used were: bibliographical review, participative observation in events for collectors secondary data collection, spontaneous conversations and semi-structured interviews. We observed that to a certain extent there was a junction of Kingdon´s (1995) three streams: a problem gained public recognition, a political environment favorable to the emergence of issues such as this agenda, and a viable alternative to the problem presented itself - the inclusion of collectors in solid waste selective collection programs -, which do not respond completely to the dimensions of the problem. Civil society organizations played an essential role in this process. However, the multiple streams model does not conceive of a ""bottom-up"" agenda setting process, nor does it consider the influence of extra-institutional actors, such as civil society organizations, on the agenda setting process. As such, the model is unable to explain the complex relations between the State and civil society in Brazilian reality.",Energy Transition

88,89,From protest to professionalization: Brazilian Environmental activism after Rio-92,"In the past decade, environmental activism in Brazil has experienced a substantial tactical shift. Many activists have gained access to national political offices, the most prominent of whom is Marina Silva at the Ministry of the Environment. This research shows that protest groups of the 1980s paved the way for a professionalized form of environmental activism that relies on a firm-like organizational profile and expert staffing. Today, far away from confrontation, environmental activism in Brazil builds on cooperative relationships between political authorities and scientific elites. In this article, the authors argue that the transmutation of the profile of activism was largely stimulated by the availability of new resources and opportunities and the presence of national and transnational alliances available after Rio-92.

90,91,¿Por qué estudiar las percepciones ambientales?: Una revisión de la literatura mexicana con énfasis en Áreas Naturales Protegidas,"Environmental perceptions are understood as the way in which every individual appreciates and values their environment and influences in an important way on man's decision making concerning the environment that surrounds them. The present paper is a brief review of the Mexican literature on environmental perceptions; analyzing how they influence the decision making concerning environmental management, with an emphasis on Protected Natural Areas (PNA). The paper ends underlining the importance of writing more papers that contribute information about the environmental perceptions of the local populations and the different social actors in PNA, both in rural and urban contexts, in order to make the implementation of the Mexican environmental policies more efficient.",Forests and Land Use
91,92,Políticas intergubernamentales para controlar la contaminación del aire en ciudades mexicanas: Una evaluación,"The increasingly evident deterioration of public health due to atmospheric pollution has forced governments to design and implement diverse policies for the control of air pollutants. Relying on quantitative methods, we investigate the effectiveness of intergovernmental policies for the abatement of air pollution in four metropolitan areas (Guadalajara, Monterrey, Valle de Mexico, and Valle de Toluca) over a ten year period. Our statistical analysis shows that, when observed concurrently, the efforts of these governments to reduce the concentrations of sulphur and nitrogen dioxids have been effective only partially. In the cases of Guadalajara and Monterrey, our qualitative analysis reveals that specific characteris-tics of these policies (the degree of participation of industries and municipal governments) and the existence of international commercial liaisons (export-oriented industries tend to adopt environmental-friendly policies) explain, to a large extent, the evolution of the concentration of pollutants in each city.",Air Pollution
92,93,Fronteiras da gestão: os conflitos ambientais das atividades portuárias,"Only recently have the Brazilian ports been a concern of environmental policy. Due to the large-scale territorial changes it induces, this activity has been associated with many conflicts. Difficulties for decisions about environmental permits related to ports are a result of the belated adoption of environmental management by the sector, especially due to the disarticulation between environmental planning and control. The environmental agenda for ports has been an initiative for establishing management plans based on consensus.",Multi-Theme
93,94,Native forest policy in Chile: understanding sectoral process dynamics in a country with an emerging economy,"Native forests in Chile are subject to an ongoing process of degradation and destruction. In 1992, the Chilean government proposed a new law aimed at the recovery and sustainable management of native forests. However, the proposal, although amended several times has not yet been transformed into law. Powerful private interest groups such as the forest industry and environmental organisations have successfully advocated against one or more of the different proposals. Notwithstanding, recent developments suggest that the worst of the process might be over and a new law may be passed in the near future. Drawing on concepts from policy sciences (advocacy coalition framework, critical sub-sector model), the present work attempts to explain the dynamics in the policy formation process as a result of the clash of fundamentally opposing policy beliefs evident in a critical issue niche or critical sub-sector that blocked changes in the overall policy sub-system for years. However, the increasing availability of private policy instruments (e.g. forest certification) allowed for the removal of this issue from the discussion about statutory policy options and thus relieved the process from a long-standing deadlock.",Forests and Land Use
