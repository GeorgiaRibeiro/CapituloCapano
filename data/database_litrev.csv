The paper examines environmental policy integration in Uruguay's forestry sector since the 1990s and is based on an inductive qualitative analysis of policy documents, sector reports, parliament hearings and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders. This demonstrates that environmental policy integration has increased continuously since the 1990s, accelerating particularly during the 2000s. We can derive three insights that specifically address this path of integration: a change in the policy beliefs of the dominant advocacy coalition, international salience of the minority coalition`s beliefs and participatory policy processes that foster interactions between opposing coalitions. Despite this, the two advocacy coalitions have crystallized with fundamentally different deep core beliefs about what a sustainable forestry sector should be. While one coalition argues that commercial tree plantations are sufficiently regulated in environmental terms, the other coalition maintains that the way that the pulp industry has developed in Uruguay is fundamentally unsustainable and therefore seeks to change the forestry sector as a whole.","[Kefeli, Daniel; Siegel, Karen M.; Dietz, Thomas] Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Polit Sci, D-48151 Munster, Germany; [Pittaluga, Lucia] Univ Republica, Sch Econ & Adm, Montevideo 11200, Uruguay","Kefeli, D (corresponding author), Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Polit Sci, D-48151 Munster, Germany.",,"Pittaluga, Lucia/0000-0001-9055-4944; Kefeli, Daniel/0000-0002-8269-5621; Siegel, Karen Meike/0000-0003-4495-1580",German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL) [2219NR291]; University of Munster; Projekt DEAL,German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL); University of Munster; Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.

While informative and relevant for participatory interventions, the literatures on collective action and participatory governance have largely remained disconnected. We illustrate how the institutional analysis and development (IAD), network of (adjacent) action situation (NAS) and social–ecological system (SES) frameworks can be combined to provide a coherent approach that integrates these literatures, applies their insights and bridges this disconnect. We compare two similar participatory interventions, one in Colombia and one in Peru, whose design and implementation we supported. Transdisciplinary in nature, both sought to foster collective action for watershed management. The frameworks allow us to demarcate, characterise and reflect upon the action situations (ASs) for the collective choice, coordination and knowledge generation that constituted each participatory intervention (i.e. the constituent NAS) and other relevant operational and institutional ASs that lay outside the boundaries of the participatory interventions. These other ASs may not be linked to one another or to the intervention’s constituent NAS, but they influence the outcomes of interest nevertheless, thereby shaping the potential of the participatory interventions for collective action and sustainable natural resource management. The framework then suggests, and our comparative analysis illustrates, that organisers and researchers of participatory interventions, such as multi-actor deliberative platforms and transdisciplinary research projects, should carefully consider, reflect upon and address the constellation of relevant actors, ASs and contexts co-determining the outcomes of interest. Our study demonstrates how the IAD, SES and NAS frameworks can support that endeavour.",Article,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,2.023,18,1,79,96,10.1007/s11625-022-01215-x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85138339111&doi=10.1007%2fs11625-022-01215-x&partnerID=40&md5=866e48ceda4185701c9767a3cc577a34,,,,Scopus

Given that temporal variation in the relationship between presidents and intermediaries can be observed, to what extent can the intermediaries included in the policy process be explained by the respective president's leadership style and/or political ideology? We concentrate on the process by which clean energy policies were formulated under three Mexican presidents between 2006 and 2022. We draw on original data collected through 18 semi-structured interviews carried out with intermediaries between January and July 2022. Our findings show that the different presidents had different policy styles and therefore varied in how they included climate intermediaries in the policy process. This finding has important implications for research on policy styles as well as climate intermediation. Regarding policy styles the results presented call for theorizing of the dynamics observed.

Yet in the face of its negative social, economic, and environmental effects, many medium-capitalized producers, petty commodity producers, and peasants have developed various food production strategies beyond extensive pesticide use. Drawing from the convergence between rural sociology and agroecology, we address the narratives and practices of farming families that are constructing alternatives to pesticides. Our analysis focuses not only on the productive dimension but also on the political and cultural aspects of the strategies that the subjects deploy when distancing themselves from the hegemonic practices of agribusiness. To approach this objective, we combine an analysis of in-depth interviews and ethnographic notes carried out in the municipality of Putaendo (Valparaiso, Chile) and the Antinaco-Los Colorados valley (La Rioja, Argentina). The article contributes to previous theoretical work on alternative agriculture by analyzing practices and narratives as seen from four different levels: microeconomics, macroeconomics, politics, and family labor. Drawing from a combination of these perspectives, the agrarian producers in our study explain and exemplify the growth, deployment, threats and staying power of practices distinct to or in opposition to agribusiness. Additionally, the research confirms that the analysis of alternatives for changing agriculture should consider the interaction between technical components, such as the reduction or elimination of chemical pesticides, economic balance, such as providing an “adequate” level of income, and cultural elements, such as the co-existence of economic systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET) / Instituto de Investigaciones Gino Germani, Facultad de Ciencias Sociales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina",,,,,,,,0,,,,Elsevier Ltd,,,14629011,,2.023,139,,149,156,10.1016/j.envsci.2022.10.015,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85141452070&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2022.10.015&partnerID=40&md5=a1de4ca36056d3d2250049e73e558fbd,,,,Scopus

I argue that the state weakens Indigenous political aspiration of sovereign territorial control by translating this agenda into depoliticized mechanisms and assumptions of modern international environmentalism, which ultimately limits their capacity to truly contribute to conservation goals.

This research examines the relationship between intermunicipal cooperation and municipal state capacities in the implementation of the environmental policy in Brazil, aiming to identify if state capacity, in different dimensions, is a relevant characteristic for municipalities participating in environmental public consortiums. This research used secondary data to employ a quantitative approach through logistic regression analysis, investigating the occurrence of intermunicipal cooperative arrangements in 4.479 Brazilian municipalities. In general terms, the results demonstrate that high administrative capacity and greater fiscal performance tend to reduce the incentives for the municipality to cooperate with others while implementing the PNMA at the local level.

Additionally, we offer seven lessons that can improve the chances of reaching an international goal and shifting the agenda: (1) attract media attention; (2) make a formal commitment; (3) launch a movement or a campaign to attain the goal; (4) make the goals legally binding; (5) propose general international goals; (6) diffuse ideas and (7) form support groups.","[Goncalves, Leandra] Univ Sao Paulo, Oceanog Inst, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [De Santo, Elizabeth M.] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Earth & Environm, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA","Goncalves, L (autor correspondente), Univ Sao Paulo, Oceanog Inst, Sao Paulo, Brazil.","Goncalves, Leandra Regina/H-7665-2012","Goncalves, Leandra Regina/0000-0003-1182-418X; De Santo, Elizabeth/0000-0003-0975-1874","FAPESP [2018/00462-8, 2019/04481-0]",FAPESP(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),This work was supported by the FAPESP [2018/00462-8 and 2019/04481-0].,55,3,3,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,2.022,31,2,205,225,10.1080/09644016.2021.1915037,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09644016.2021.1915037,Environmental Studies; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Government & Law,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, CE initiatives in the Global South have tended to extrapolate developed countries’ perspectives, as if the CE provides a global and universal benchmark to converge to. Drawing from a political ecology of waste in Latin America and building on empirical data derived from two case studies of recycling initiatives in Argentina, we focus on how the issue of formalisation of previously informal recyclers could be framed within the CE. Then, we outline two contrasting models, the privatisation of informality on the one hand and the formalisation of commoning on the other. Thus we highlight the extent to which the CE narrative could be used to overlook power relations dynamics, or, to what extent it could be reframed to foster a CE “from below” that could provide a clear path to achieve greater levels of equity and social justice. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,55251753300;57212412250;55834663700;,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,2.022,27,10-11,1338,1354,10.1080/13549839.2022.2048258,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127171165&doi=10.1080%2f13549839.2022.2048258&partnerID=40&md5=f2562161aba54ce767c9588468fd032f,,,,Scopus

This paper assesses the possibilities and limits for mobilising this format of site-specific green infrastructure in cities in low-and middle-income countries beset by air pollution and multiple other socio-environmental challenges, and particularly questions the definition of green fences as a green infrastructure for air quality (GI4AQ). We applied several qualitative and action research methods to the question of green fence implementation in Buenos Aires, Argentina—a Latin American city with weak air-quality policies, limited green infrastructure, and little experience with nature-based solutions. Firstly, we conducted a literature review of the role that urban vegetation and ecosystem services may play in AQ policy and the implementation barriers to such approaches globally and in the city. Secondly, we planned, designed, constructed, maintained, and evaluated a pilot green fence in a school playground. Thirdly, we carried out supplementary interviews with stakeholders and expert informants and compiled project members’ narratives to respectively characterise the barriers that the project encountered and delineate its attributes based on the associated actions that we took to overcome such barriers to implementation and complete the pilot. Our findings identify multiple barriers across seven known categories (institutional, engagement, political, socio-cultural, built environment and natural landscape, knowledge base and financial) and highlight examples not previously considered in the extant international literature. Furthermore, learning from this experience, the paper proposes an expanded model of green infrastructure for air quality plus multi-dimensional co-benefits (GI4AQ+) to increase implementation chances by attending to local needs and priorities. © 2022 by the authors.

Imitating other far-right populists and their antienvironmental rhetoric, especially Donald Trump's, Bolsonaro attempted to use the topic to inflame his domestic supporters against international players. On the one hand, this strategy weakened Brazilian influence in bilateral and multilateral forums; on the other, dismantling environmental policies and governance structures had substantial consequences, especially in deforestation rates and attacks on traditional communities. This article analyzes the Bolsonaro administration's stand on the environment and climate issues and the repercussions of its policies and rhetoric in Brazil's domestic and foreign scenarios. We conclude that changes in the international context, especially after Trump's electoral defeat in the United States, led to a softening of Bolsonaro's international environmental and climate discourse, with no substantial policy changes internally. Although climate denialism is a centerpiece of the discourse of far-right populists, this empirical analysis indicates that, in the case of Brazil, this narrative did not bring significant results to Bolsonaro in terms of support or international relevance.","[Toni, Ana; Chaves, Cintya Feitosa] Inst Clima & Soc, Rua Gen Dionisio 14 Humana, BR-22271050 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","Chaves, CF (autor correspondente), Inst Clima & Soc, Rua Gen Dionisio 14 Humana, BR-22271050 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",,,,,,118,0,0,5,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2041-7365,2041-7373,2.022,13,2,464,483,10.1111/lamp.12268,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lamp.12268,Political Science,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Government & Law,View Full Record in Web of Science

It illustrates the analytical framework by empirically investigating the drivers of policy (dis)integration in Brazil’s subnational water policy introduced in the 2010s. The level of confict between coalitions, adjustment of policy beliefs, coordination within and across coalitions, and existence of venues for interaction and policy-oriented learning were presented as factors that can foster or hinder the integration of public policies. Moreover, the study discusses the potential to acknowledge in ACF the mechanisms for coordinating policy actors and instruments, which would facilitate the analysis of the policy processes of cooperation. It also demonstrates that recent droughts in Northeast Brazil have been increasingly related to the local impacts of climate change, contributing to reframing water management as a cross-sectoral climate and water governance issue.

These areas have been significantly deforested over the last 50 years due to public policies and land privatization aiming at economic development, agricultural, and agribusiness expansion in Central and Amazonian Brazil. These political and economic drivers contributed to the conversion of five million hectares of Seasonal Evergreen Forests and Cerrados (Brazilian savanna) into agricultural land. To reverse the damaging trends threatening the future of the Xingu River and to promote common benefits to indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, the Campaign fostered the creation of the Xingu Seed Network to promote the exchange and commercialization of native seeds demanded by farmers and landholders for planting and restoring permanent preservation areas, such as riparian forests and vegetation associated with lakes and springs of the Suiá-Miçu River Basin. The aim of this study is to examine the role played by the Y Ikatu Campaign in the conservation of these common-pool resources—Xingu’s headwaters, riparian forests, and rivers—and in mobilizing heterogeneous social groups living in this region to engage in the protection of the watershed. Our analysis focuses on socially and culturally diverse inhabitants (indigenous and farmers) of the Suiá-Miçu River Basin, who are searching for innovative technologies for the recovery of riparian areas and for income generation for local communities. The Institutional Analysis and Development framework was adopted as an approach for understanding interactions of multiple social agents, governmental and non-governmental organizations, engaged in the process of restoration and protection of common resources. Spatial and temporal land-cover changes analysis of the Suiá-Miçu River Basin show an increase in deforestation during the past 40 years, primarily for soybean farming and pastures.

We find that the Bolsonaro administration centralises environmental governance in Brazil through complementary authoritarian and populist means. First in restricting participatory decision-making spaces such as the National Environmental Council (Conama) and the National Council of the Legal Amazon (CNAL), and, second, by attacking indigenous and traditional peoples, NGOs, scientists, and other environmental defenders. To illustrate the authoritarian dimension of Bolsonaro's environmental governance, we carry out a political-institutional analysis of contemporary Brazilian environmental politics and then exemplify the ways and extent to which attacks against environmental defenders is a constituent part of Bolsonaro's environmental populism.

Unlike the MI, there was an institutional change in social policy under the responsibility of the MDS, with the critical moment being the institutionalization of the Unified Social Assistance System (SUAS) with federative coordination mechanisms and a continuous flow of resources. Positive and learning policy feedback occurred in the federative relationship and with civil society. Originality: The analysis of the national experience of the past twenty years on the topic of coordination still has gaps. Considering the different analytical dimensions together, it allowed us to understand the specifics of each institutional arrangement and the extent to which they advance in terms of coordinating different actors in the decision-making processes. Theoretical and practical contributions:This work contributed to a better understanding of the challenges of federative coordination of intersectoral public policies to combat poverty in a complex institutional environment. The research also adds to the knowledge base of the literature on institutional arrangements by bringing the case study of a program linked to Regional Policy in Brazil, until then little studied under this theoretical approach.","[Ramagem, Ricardo Dias] Univ Brasilia PPGA UnB, Programa Posgrad Adm, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Gomes, Ricardo Correa] Escola Adm Empresas Fundacao Getulio Vargas EAESP, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil","Ramagem, RD (corresponding author), Univ Brasilia PPGA UnB, Programa Posgrad Adm, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",,,,,,55,0,0,0,2,UNIV FEDERAL VICOSA,VICOSA,"CAIXA POSTAL 270, VICOSA, MG CEP 36571-00, BRAZIL",2175-5787,,2.021,13,2,,,,,Public Administration,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Public Administration,Web of Science Record

The study shows how policy entrepreneurs took advantage of a general tax reform bill to promote the idea of a carbon tax. Mainly driven by international emulation and reputational gains concerns, the carbon tax proposal successfully advanced through the government ' s internal drafting process of the Tax Reform Bill, however, it faced strong opposition during the legislative decision-making process, which resulted in the adoption of a weaker carbon tax. From a climate politics perspective, the Argentine carbon tax case suggests the political limitations of an over-reliance on international reputation arguments to advance climate policy innovation. In relation to the MSA, the study highlights how policy windows can shape processes of policy innovation and the analytical convenience of differentiating the coupling processes between the agenda-setting and decision-making stages.","[Ryan, Daniel] Inst Tecnol Buenos Aires ITBA, Dept Invest & Doctorado, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Micozzi, Mariana] Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales FLACSO, Maestria Derecho & Econ Cambio Climatico, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",dryan@itba.edu.ar,,"Ryan, Daniel/0000-0003-4699-5448",,,,41,4,4,4,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-4016,1743-8934,2.021,30,7,1155,1173,,10.1080/09644016.2021.1899648,Environmental Studies; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),WOS:000630657200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The commodities boom that the region experienced during the early 2000s was accompanied by the resurgence of populism in the region and the emergence of socio-environmental conflicts led by indigenous environmental movements. Despite the fact that Latin American populism supposedly represents unprotected groups, there has been a general failure on the part of these governments to incorporate the visions and demands of the indigenous peoples. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLO) assumed Mexico's presidency in 2018. In this context, his reliance on extractive industries as a lever for socioeconomic development and criticism towards neoliberalism has led many analysts to place him under the populist umbrella. AMLO has developed a discursive strategy consisting of dividing the political field into two antagonistic parts: 'the people', whose demands and interests are supposedly defended by his popular project and 'the conservatives', the corrupt elite. This article explores the way in which AMLO has reacted to the indigenous environmental movements and his discursive strategies to face the contradiction of constructing the hegemony of the people without incorporating indigenous voices. The article develops a frame analysis applied to AMLO's discourse on a large-scale energy project: Proyecto Integral Morelos (PIM). It concludes that, as with other populists in the region, AMLO has been shown to be incapable of articulating the indigenous environmental opposition into his national project.","[Solorio, Israel; Guzman, Jorge] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Sch Polit & Social Sci, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Ortega, Joel] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Ctr Interdisciplinary Res Sci & Humanities, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Romero, Raul] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Social Res Inst, Mexico City, DF, Mexico","Solorio, I (corresponding author), Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Sch Polit & Social Sci, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.","Solorio, Israel/HKF-3177-2023","Solorio, Israel/0000-0001-9609-7916; Ortega Erreguerena, Joel Alejandro/0000-0002-8865-4951",National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) [IA302721],National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)(Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico),"This article is result of the PAPIIT research grant IA302721 'AMLO's populist frame: a transversal study of the policy of the 4T (POPUL4T), funded by the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).",76,9,9,2,9,SPRINGER VIEWEG-SPRINGER FACHMEDIEN WIESBADEN GMBH,WIESBADEN,"ABRAHAM-LINCOLN STASSE 46, WIESBADEN, 65189, GERMANY",1865-2646,1865-2654,2.021,15,2,249,273,10.1007/s12286-021-00486-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12286-021-00486-5,Political Science,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Government & Law,Web of Science Record

The Brazilian trade in forest certificates (CRA) is a new market instrument that allows farmers that have deforested illegally prior to 2008 to become compliant by acquiring certificates from other farmers that conserve a forest area beyond legal requirements. Even though the CRA market has been praised as an innovative environmental policy, it is still unclear whether it will be implemented even after more than two decades of political debate, congressional approval of legislation and substantial investments in new supporting systems. This research paper aims to analyze the materialization of this market by reconstructing how policy participants form advocacy coalitions (i.e. environmental protection, market viability and agricultural consolidation) to advance their interests. Our results show that advocacy coalitions filter (i.e. absorb, reject or transform) new ideas, experiences and knowledge in order to influence the regulations for forest certificate trading. In doing so, they often combine positions, form new alliances and merge with other advocacy coalitions in accordance with the interests of their constituents. These fluid allegiances within and between coalitions explain why market materialization remains ambiguous and unlikely to become operational in the near future.

Design/methodology/approach - Theoretical background is based on the advocacy coalition framework (ACF), new discursive institutionalism and critical discourse analysis theories. The research examines shorthand notes of public hearings held in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate between 1999 and 2012, carrying out a case study on Belo Monte hydroelectric power plant. The speech extracts were categorized according to the modes of operation of ideology and typical strategies of symbolic construction proposed by Thompson (1995). Findings - The results suggest that the discourse can be an instrument of internal coordination and between coalitions that share beliefs about a policy, as in the case of Belo Monte. Potentially existing coalitions define their identities and set positions on controversial issues, aligning interests and expectations. In the case studied, the modes of operation of ideology verified as instruments of the coalitions were dissimulation, reification, fragmentation, unification and legitimation. Research limitations/implications - The paper represents a unique analysis of the modes of operation of ideology (Thompson, 1999) in the case of Belo Monte. In addition, the paper aims to contribute to the New Discursive Institutionalism and to the ACF when it uses the critical discourse analysis to articulate a method to analyze the use of the Discourse by the coalitions. In fact, such an approach integrating the ACF, the New Discursive Institutionalism and the critical discourse analysis is something original. Finally, it also addresses a gap in ACF: issues related to advocacy coalition coordination. Practical implications - Attentive readers linked to organizations working on infrastructure and environmental policies can benefit from the results by envisaging the deliberate manipulation of typical symbolic construction strategies and general modes of operation of ideology. Social implications - The study sheds light on the daily and behind-the-scenes disputes among stakeholders who are interested in a certain public policy. It may draw attention to the acres and professional use of the shorthand notes of the hearings held at the National Congress. Originality/value - This paper aims to fill a gap pointed out by Jenkins-Smith et al (2014) regarding problems of coordination of advocacy coalitions. In addition, it innovates by using critical discourse analysis as a methodological reference in ACF empirical studies.

In this paper, we study the processes by which four Latin American countries modified their existing institutions to manage the effects or large-scale mining in their territories. We focus on the political struggles to introduce legislation to restrict the geographical expansion of large-scale mining in their territories. To this end, we integrate a leading theory of the policy process with theoretical insights from studies of environmental governance and political settlements. Our findings show that processes of policy change followed distinct paths with common elements. The elements that link the initial conditions with change are policy learning, challenges to dominant policy images, conflict expansion, and the involvement of veto players. We also observe that the outputs of the reforms diverge significantly. Three contextual variables contributed to the variability of the outputs of these reforms; the degree of cohesion of elites, the degree of development of environmental institutions, and the relative dependency on mineral revenues. During the processes of policy making, these institutions offered different opportunities and constraints for policy challengers to advance their agenda and for dominant actors to maintain the status quo. The new policy designs offer opportunities for countries to deal with the effects of mining on sensitive ecosystems but political instability threatens the long-term institutionalization of these reforms.","[Cisneros, Paul] Inst Altos Estudios Nacl, Ctr Gobierno & Adm Publ, Quito, Ecuador",pcisneros@ucdavis.edu,"Cisneros, Paul/H-4208-2019","Cisneros, Paul/0000-0003-0562-283X",,,,124,2,2,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1541-132X,1541-1338,2.020,37,5,687,712,,10.1111/ropr.12400,Political Science; Public Administration,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),WOS:000578640700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Two of these shocks were external: (i) the election of a new political elite in power that brought a clear discourse of denial of the relevance of environmental policy and (ii) calamitous environmental events that occurred in Brazil in 2019. The other two shocks were internal: (i) the capture of key positions and resources by dominant coalition members and (ii) the rise of conflict and polarization among the coalitions in the subsystem. The results showed: (i) the rise of a hyper-adversarial environmental policy subsystem; (ii) a realignment between non-dominant coalitions in a cooperative direction; (iii) the imposition of clear barriers to negotiation; (iv) changes in the use of scientific information by more politicized discourses with a high degree of bias.

Policy network analysis is a way to explore connections between adaptation and mitigation, and the opportunities or barriers to effective integration between these two policy subdomains. This study explores climate governance and policy networks by examining collaboration and information flows in national policy processes in Peru, a country with an active climate change policy domain. In contrast to most climate policy network analyses, this study distinguishes adaptation and mitigation subdomains through a multiplex approach. We used ERGM (Exponential Random Graph Models) to explain the existence of information flows and collaborations among 76 key actors in climate change policy in Peru. We identified actors who could connect adaptation and mitigation subdomains. Results show a concentration of influence in national government actors, particularly in the mitigation subdomain, and the isolation of actor groups that matter for policy implementation, such as the private sector or subnational actors. Results highlight the predominance of mitigation over adaptation and the existence of actors well positioned to broker relationships between the subdomains. The top brokers across subdomains were, however, not only actors with high centrality and brokerage roles in the subdomains, but also several 'unusual key players' that were not brokers in any of the two layers separately. Key policy insights National government institutions are central actors in climate change policy networks in Peru, reflecting national ownership of the climate change issue.

This article analyzes the representations of water and gold, and the superposition of the territorialities of the different social groups (Santurban population, Bucaramanga population, foreign company, and State) in 2011 as an effect of the socio-environmental conflict over industrial mining in the moor. To do this, the researchers carried out an exercise in narrative interpretation of semi-structured interviews with residents and social groups in the municipalities of Vetas, California, and the city of Bucaramanga, who argue the importance of water and gold in their daily lives. The population of Santurbán conceives water as fundamental for its existence and the gold for its economy, traditions, and culture. Meanwhile, for the population of Bucaramanga, the representation of water is related to environmental ethics. This overlap triggers previously invisible conflicts between two neighboring populations that have jointly benefited from the moorland. © Jungseok Research Institute of International Logistics and Trade.

Paradoxically, Colombia is also the sixth largest coal exporter globally, and its government has adopted policies to further increase the country's production of coal and other fossil fuels. This article explores to what extent the national government reproduces a powerful paradigm - namely, that fossil fuel extraction is necessary for development - and how this resonates at the sub-national level. We find that the government's narrative has evolved to accommodate Colombia's changing national circumstances and public criticism. Though counternarratives exist, they have struggled to propose credible nationwide alternatives to extractive-based development, thus reinforcing the belief that extraction-based development is unavoidable. We describe how government narratives constitute an obstacle to both supply-side policies to restrict fossil fuel development and to transitional assistance policies to adjust to shifts in the global coal market. Key policy insights The view that fossil fuel extraction is necessary for development is a powerful barrier to supply - side climate policy. This view also hinders the formulation of transitional assistance policy. Empirical evidence that fossil fuel extraction seldom leads to equitable development is not enough to overcome this view. Narratives on fossil fuel-based development continuously adjust to prevailing economic development paradigms and contemporary development challenges.","[Strambo, Claudia] Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Gonzalez Espinosa, Ana Carolina] Univ Externado Colombia, Bogota, Colombia","Strambo, C (corresponding author), Stockholm Environm Inst, Stockholm, Sweden.",,"Strambo, Claudia/0000-0003-3673-5853",Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida),Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida)(Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),This study was funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) through core support to the Stockholm Environment Institute.

When the Workers' Party first took office in 2003, many social movement actors joined the government, especially in that agency. After 2007, however, most of these activists left the government. At the same time, the ministry substituted thousands of temporary employees for permanent civil servants. Surprisingly, this study finds that these public employees carried forward the environmentalist cause, even when this required contesting the priorities of superiors. Examining their attitudes and practices leads to a definition of activism as the proactive pursuit of opportunities to defend contentious causes. The case study helps to develop this concept and to demonstrate that workers inside bureaucracies can engage in activist behavior.

This network originated from the Campaign `Y Ikatu Xingu, a social phenomenon concerning conservation and protection of the Xingu spring region. The river basin of the Xingu headwaters, 17 million hectares, is the main focus of XSN and it has lost five million hectares of forests and cerrados, which were converted into grain monoculture fields, within a very short period of time. The impact on the quality of the river water caused an environmental and health problem for the indigenous peoples of the indigenous lands. XSN has promoted innovative technological alternatives for recovery of permanent preservation areas (PPAs) or gallery forest and income generation for small farmers and local communities. The goal of this study is to analyze the environmental governance in the Xingu basin, paying particular attention to institutional arrangements of the Xingu Seeds Network. This analysis is grounded on the theoretical-methodological framework, contained in the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD), which offers tools for understanding the strengthening process of democratic institutions in the protection of common-pool resources.

We focus on the Brazilian Amazon to synthesize classical frontier theory and emerging perspectives with special attention to the role of governance in frontier development. Since 2004, primary deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has declined over 70 percent while agricultural production in the region has increased. Contrary to narratives that view this transition as the result of ‘frontier governance’ – i.e., the imposition of order on a pre-existing frontier – we propose the concept of a ‘governance frontier,’ which recognizes the role of politics in constructing and transforming frontier spaces. This concept politicizes economic accounts of frontier development and spatializes   notions of governance. We employ a ‘follow the policy’ methodology to trace the evolution of a governance frontier in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, drawing on original fieldwork across four Amazonian municipalities and inside an environmental non-governmental organization. We show that a key feature of the Amazonian governance frontier has been a distinct geographical configuration of ‘model municipalities’ that function as nodes of policy experimentation, legitimation, and transfer. Our findings support an integration of frontier theory and governance theory in a place-based, political geography approach to regional political-economic transformation, which demands greater attention to the political dimensions of frontiers and to the spatial dimensions of governance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,,57191152567;55657551700;8441901600;,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: DGE-1144153; National Stroke Foundation, NSF","We are deeply grateful to the inhabitants of Santarém, Lucas, Paragominas, and São Félix, and the staff of TNC-Brazil.

Simultaneously, it reflects on emerging forms of nexus thinking and policy that seek to identify and govern connections between diverse sectors, and especially water, energy and food. Both of these fields of scholarship are concerned with connections, of different kinds, and at different spatial scales. Based on a large-scale, mixed-method research project in São Paulo State, Brazil, this paper explores how these rather different literatures could be combined in order to (re)think notions of (re)connection that operate across different spatial, political and material registers. Through research with Brazilian professionals and young people about their experiences of, and learning about, the water–energy–food nexus, the paper makes several substantive contributions to scholarship on childhood, youth, environmental education and nexus thinking. Centrally, it is argued that, rather than dispense with them, there are manifold possibilities for expanding and complicating notions of (re)connection, which rely on a more nuanced analysis of the logistical, technical, social and political contexts in which nexuses are constituted. Thus, our work flips dominant forms of nexus thinking by privileging a “bottom-up” analysis of (especially) young people's everyday, embodied engagements with water, food and energy. Our resultant findings indicated that young people are “connected” with natures and with the water–energy–food nexus, in both fairly conventional ways and in ways that significantly extend beyond contemporary discourses about childhoods–natures (and particularly in articulating the importance of care and community). Consequently, the nexus approach that is advocated in this paper could enable more nuanced, politically aware conceptualisations of (re)connection, both within and beyond scholarship on childhoods–natures and nexus thinking.

Brazil produced 14.8 GW of wind powered energy in 2019, 85.7% of this total in the Northeastern region. Social and environmental fragilities of local communities, overlooked an exclusionary planning, have led to opposition movements against wind farm implementation. This study aims to assess how the arrival of wind power dialogues with the demands of the communities living in the projects' vicinities, as well as repercussions on institutional, socio-economic and environmental developments. A case study was conducted with regard to the Galinhos' community reaction to the arrival of wind power. First, public domain narratives were evaluated, in order to ascertain the different perceptions from the social actors involved in the process. Next, the community's vision was assessed regarding expectations and fears, created by the existence of the wind farm, before and after its implementation. The perception was that the wind farm did not change the population's socioeconomic conditions and environmental issues require appraisals by the accountable bodies. In this scenario, the materiality of the narrative that justifies wind farm expansion in the Brazilian northeast was assessed. © 2019 by the authors.","Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Rio Grande do Norte (IFRN), Natal, 59015-000, Brazil; Energy Planning Program (PPE), Coordination of Post-Graduation Programs in Eng. of the Federal Univ. of Rio de Janeiro (COPPE/UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, 21941-914, Brazil; Society for Urban Ecology, Salzburg, 5020, Austria; International Virtual Institute of Global Change (IVIG), Rio de Janeiro, 21941-909, Brazil; Electrical Power Research Center (CEPEL), Rio de Janeiro, 21944-970, Brazil","E.J.A.

As a consequence, the water sector is facing increasing pressures at the social, economic, environmental and political levels. This new scenario generates high levels of uncertainty that increase tensions over the access to water. The diverse valuations and uses given by the multiple stake-holders interested in this resource make traditional management and governance models based on the theory ofcommand and control inadequate. This paper theoretically analyzes different conceptions and models of water governance, their characteristics, levels and scales of operation, identifying potentials and limitations to face complex and dynamic contexts. At the empirical level the Chilean case is explored since there is a water market for this resource allocation. To develop the analytical framework on the concept of water governance, a compilation and selection (directed review of literature) of recent research on the subject was carried out by consulting scientific articles published in internationally recognized journals and with high impact in the area of social sciences, interdisciplinary and water resources. The results show that a rigid, centralized system with legislation that prioritizes private interests before public interests causes inequity in access to water and needs a change in its structure that allow it to face the new conditions of dynamic and complex systems. On the other hand, the concept of water governance must be addressed as a socio-ecological system and it is not pertinent to analyze the water system in isolation.

This article problematizes these ideas by deepening the understanding of participatory mechanisms within broader environmental governance structures. The focus of the article is Peru, the first Latin American country that has passed a General Law of prior consultation for indigenous peoples, and currently is struggling to articulate this mechanism to participatory stages in EIAs. From an engagement with the literature on political ecology and development studies, this article explores the limitations of indigenous participation within an environmental governance that prioritize the promotion of investments in extractive industries. In particular, by exploring the challenges and limitations of indigenous decision-making power in new institutions for consultation and EIA participation, the article holds that participatory mechanisms themselves are unable to provide more power of decision to indigenous peoples if policy-makers translate claims for institutional transformation (related to indigenous self-determination and ecological zoning) into merely participatory provisions of specific projects. The result is a paradoxical multiplication of weak participatory channels, making the voices of local communities and indigenous peoples auditable, however, without a real compromise to translate these concerns into public policies beyond participatory processes. This study is a qualitative investigation whose data collection methods included semi-structured interviews, observation and documentary analysis. The author undertook 38 semi-structured interviews in 2016–2017 with key relevant actors (from state offices, indigenous organizations, and civil society organizations) involved in consultation processes and participation in EIAs, and documentary analysis of EIAs, reports, legal regulations and policy instruments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,,57196044733;,,,"This research was supported by the Universidad del Pacífico (Lima, Perú).

The framework provides a terminology for defining what constitutes institutional context, comparing economic, regulatory and information instruments, and studying their interactions.

In 1992, concern over rapid land conversion to timber plantations (Pinus radiata and Eucalyptus spp.) in Chile gave rise to a protracted policy process resulting in the 2008 Native Forest Law (NFL), which subsidizes reforestation and management with native forest. To date, however, NFL has had little impact on native forest conservation. To understand how the policy process that created the NFL shaped its outcomes, we employed the Dyna-CLUE modeling approach to simulate land use changes in south-central Chile from 1993 to 2007, based on 3 scenarios: (1) enactment of NFL in 1993 when the law was originally debated, and the different configurations of subsidies and regulations proposed in the NFL policy debate by (2) the industrial forestry coalition and (3) the forest conservation coalition. We observed no major difference in native forest loss between simulated outcomes of the industry-advocated policy and the actual NFL legislation. The conservation coalition's policy scenario increased native forest area, primarily in shrub steppe areas, but also via conversion of pine plantations if incentive payments were large enough. However, NFL payments are inadequate to make native forest management a viable economic land use alternative to industrial pine plantations, which are also subsidized in Chile. Gains in native forest cover occurred mostly on lands under ancestral indigenous claims (unrelated to the discussion of the NFL). We conclude that the NFL, even if enacted in 1993, would have been ineffective in preventing native forest loss, because tree plantations are more profitable and NFL regulations were weakened by the industrial coalition that opposed-and strongly shaped-the final legislation. Effective incentives for protecting early-successional forests and shrublands are needed to mitigate further losses and foster recovery of Chile's native forests.","Department of Forest and Natural Resources Management, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, NY 13210, United States. bUniversidad Bernardo O Higgins, Centro de Investigación en Recursos Naturales y Sustentabilidad, General Gana 1702, Santiago, Chile",,,,,,,,31,,,,,,,,,2.016,51,,350,362,10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.08.032,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960423059&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2015.08.032&partnerID=40&md5=fed7f1134fa40f6a908e5d519dd2bc18,,,,Scopus

It aims at discussing the Initiative as an innovation on the political agenda based on the social construction of oil exploitation in the Ecuadorian Amazon as a public problem, the development of alternative solutions and their government recognition. The research is grounded on the Kingdon's Multiple Streams Model (MSM) in the agenda setting process, from an extensive literature review. The data concerning the Initiative was collected primarily on scientific literature, as well as documents of institutions and organizations involved in its formulation. Although the Initiative has not been implemented, its evolution in the agenda has highlighted the links between local, territorial disputes and national economic issues, the possibility of economic compensation and a moratorium on exploitation, as well as raising questions concerning political legitimacy. These flows’ linkage was possible through a political window centered on climate change and varied agents such as the Presidency, oil companies, NGOs and social movements, as well as international institutions and other governments. The main contributions to the discussion of public policy and agenda setting concern: the relevance of the combination of discourses, moral (biodiversity, human rights and climate change) and economic in this case; the strong correlation between different scales (national and international) in understanding the political flow; and the procedural view of agents in leading flows and policy windows, by changing their relative capabilities of exercising power.","[Santos, Rodrigo Salles Pereira dos] Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; [Milanez, Bruno] Universidade Federal de Juiz de Fora, Brazil",,"Santos, Rodrigo Salles Pereira dos/M-7696-2019; Santos, Rodrigo S P/C-5590-2013; Milanez, Bruno/G-1233-2012","Santos, Rodrigo Salles Pereira dos/0000-0003-3640-3365; Santos, Rodrigo S P/0000-0003-3640-3365; Milanez, Bruno/0000-0002-5330-7407",,,,70,0,0,0,1,,,,1678-9873,,2.016,24,59,39,65,10.1590/1678-987316245903,,Political Science; Sociology,SciELO Brazil,Government & Law; Sociology,Scielo

The discussion focuses on the several instances in which both industrial actors and oppositional groups have stabilized those conflicts by sitting down at formally established dialogue tables, which, as we will see, have conducted public and private processes of regulation. In particular, we follow two paths: one promoted and overseen by the public sector and the other a process of self-organization and self-control of the industry at the national and global levels, which initially led to processes of self-certification and third-party certification. We argue that it cannot be reduced to an industrial learning due to the economic cost of disease outbreaks but rather that it is the outcome of a contested political process with interplay between global and local actors. This argument challenges the learning narratives espoused by the industry, contributing to a political ecology of certification processes.

This is particularly true in moments of environmental crises, when transparency regimes are most likely to emerge as an integral part of the palette of blame-avoidance strategies of accountors in their attempt to disqualify accountees' perceptions of environmental harm and irreparable loss. Drawing upon the study of blame-avoidance strategies in political science, we discuss the emergence and evolution over time of deforestation monitoring in Brazil, a transparency regime based on GIS and remote sensing led by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research since 1989. We arrive at three conclusions. First, the evolution of transparency regimes is conflictual, culturally embedded, and emergent. Second, the relation between accountors and accountees changes over time as blame-avoidance strategies unfold. Finally, solutions in a blame game may cause a future crisis, as the social context changes and becomes incompatible with the transparency regime of the day. Based on these considerations, we argue for the need to understand the instrumental dimension of transparency regimes alongside their normative and substantive dimensions.","[Rajao, Raoni] Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Prod Engn, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil; [Georgiadou, Yola] Univ Twente, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands","Rajao, R (autor correspondente), Univ Fed Minas Gerais, Dept Prod Engn, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.","Rajão, Raoni/GPX-3719-2022","Rajão, Raoni/0000-0002-1133-4837",,,,33,21,22,1,19,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1526-3800,1536-0091,2.014,14,4,97,+,10.1162/GLEP_a_00259,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/GLEP_a_00259,Environmental Studies; International Relations; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; International Relations; Government & Law,View Full Record in Web of Science

Instead, since their actions can directly affect climate outcomes alone or in small groupings, large emitters are more responsive to domestic cost-benefit calculations, making international commitments based on shifting interest group pressures at home.

Literature on the council shows that the presence of specialized knowledge can generate assymetrical power relations among actors, permitting the more skilled sectors control over political and deliberative processes. . This enables us to see how the presence of theoretical knowledge within the councils can lead to their depolitization, demonstrated by the use of technical, scientific, juridical and bureaucratic terms and procedures that empty the councils of their political functions. According to the obstacles we have pointed out, existing literature advocates efforts toward a reduction in technical management in favor of a repolitization of these spaces. . The results of the study we have developed here partially confirm elements present within the literature. Our conclusions indicate that specialized knowledge is an element that is inherent to the functioning of environmental councils. Furthermore, reduction of technical elements may prove harmful in terms of the quality of acts and deliberations that emerge from the Conama, with onus for the legal apparatus of Brazilian environmental legislation and negative impact on the implementation of public policy.","[Moura, Adriana Maria Magalhães de] Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada; [Fonseca, Igor Ferraz da] Instituto de Pesquisa Econômica Aplicada; [Fonseca, Igor Ferraz da] Universidade de Brasília; [Bursztyn, Marcel] Universidade de Brasília",,,,,,,48,0,6,1,6,,,,1678-9873,,2.012,20,42,183,198,,,Political Science; Sociology,SciELO Brazil,Government & Law; Sociology,Scielo

The article discusses the case of the system for the environmental licencing of rural properties (SLAPR), an institutional development initiative by the state government of Mato Grosso in the south-eastern portion of the Brazilian Amazon. It will be shown that even though this initiative has earned the status of best practice in controlling deforestation, a closer look at SLAPR reveals that it has led to contradictory outcomes. During the first 8?years of SLAPR, it had no significant impact on reducing deforestation and, in some cases, even permitted the increase of total deforestation by providing authorization for this. According to an institutional analysis of the case study, the article draws particular conclusions that could be relevant to public administrators in the region and in other countries. In particular, it is argued that by accepting the possibility of institutional subversion, public administrators may become more attentive to unexpected consequences and be able to take corrective action. Furthermore, in order to avoid institutional subversion, public administrators should integrate institutional initiatives into broader governmental, technological and economical dimensions.

The methodological procedures used were: bibliographical review, participative observation in events for collectors secondary data collection, spontaneous conversations and semi-structured interviews. We observed that to a certain extent there was a junction of Kingdon´s (1995) three streams: a problem gained public recognition, a political environment favorable to the emergence of issues such as this agenda, and a viable alternative to the problem presented itself - the inclusion of collectors in solid waste selective collection programs -, which do not respond completely to the dimensions of the problem. Civil society organizations played an essential role in this process. However, the multiple streams model does not conceive of a ""bottom-up"" agenda setting process, nor does it consider the influence of extra-institutional actors, such as civil society organizations, on the agenda setting process. As such, the model is unable to explain the complex relations between the State and civil society in Brazilian reality.","[Teixeira, Marco Antonio Carvalho] EAESP-FGV, Brasil; [Pereira, Maria Cecília Gomes] Fundação Getulio Vargas, Brasil",,,,,,,34,10,21,0,11,"Fundação Getulio Vargas, Escola Brasileira de Administração Pública e de Empresas",,,1679-3951,9,2.011,9,3,895,913,,,Management,SciELO Brazil,Business & Economics,Scielo

Many activists have gained access to national political offices, the most prominent of whom is Marina Silva at the Ministry of the Environment. This research shows that protest groups of the 1980s paved the way for a professionalized form of environmental activism that relies on a firm-like organizational profile and expert staffing. Today, far away from confrontation, environmental activism in Brazil builds on cooperative relationships between political authorities and scientific elites. In this article, the authors argue that the transmutation of the profile of activism was largely stimulated by the availability of new resources and opportunities and the presence of national and transnational alliances available after Rio-92.

Powerful private interest groups such as the forest industry and environmental organisations have successfully advocated against one or more of the different proposals. Notwithstanding, recent developments suggest that the worst of the process might be over and a new law may be passed in the near future.
